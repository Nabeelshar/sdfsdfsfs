Chapter 2 A Hit-and-Run gone wrong

Ou Muchong, dressed in a beige linen shirt, leaned back on the sofa with his arms crossed, watching the next item appear on the screen with a cold expression.

Feeling the burning gaze, he turned to look at the handsome boy who had just won the bid for his favorite piece of jewelry. The boy wore an ordinary sleeveless T-shirt and loose-fitting shorts that didn't go past his knees, revealing arms and legs that were surprisingly muscular and appeared slender and long.

Ou Muchong felt that the boy in front of him shouldn't be in a bar, but rather in a sterile glass enclosure with Rose.

And at that moment, the boy was frowning, glaring at him with an expression that said, "We're doomed."

Ignoring his anxiety, Ou Muchong asked, "What's your name?"

Qiao Jinyi suppressed the urge to unleash a torrent of abuse and anxiously said, "We won!"

"..." Ou Muchong said coldly, "Don't get excited."

His tone was quick, and Ou Muchong assumed he was excited out of joy, so he patiently explained, "Because you bid so high, others would think you were determined to win, so they didn't raise the price further, doing you a favor. And this price is definitely in line with the seller's estimate; it's normal for jewelry to double in price."

"What? I shouldn't get excited? I won! It's all your fault..." Qiao Jinyi angrily turned his head, opened the page, and fumbled for the undo function.

His cheeks puffed out, and he pounded them repeatedly before finally scratching his head in frustration.

Ou Muchong asked, somewhat puzzled, "Didn't you want it?"

Although he hadn't expected any gratitude or reward from the handsome boy, he hadn't anticipated being blamed.

Qiao Jinyi said dejectedly, "Of course I want it, but I don't have twenty million."

Ou Muchong sensed a bit of trouble. He had only offered a method to achieve his goal on a whim, but it had unexpectedly triggered a terrible chain reaction, making him regret his impulsiveness.

So he decided to end the trouble simply and bluntly: "You can have it, I'll buy it."

He had expected to see shame and embarrassment on the young boy's face, but instead, the boy's big eyes practically shot lasers, and his fluffy head lolled close to his face, earnestly reminding him, "Then you'd better not renege on your debt."

Ou Muchong was almost amused by his words, and said pointedly, "I wouldn't do such a thing."

Liang Jinwei noticed the two people talking and raised an eyebrow in surprise. If he wasn't mistaken, their conversation didn't seem to be going very well.

He walked over and sat down next to his younger brother, protectively extending his arm to drape over the back of the sofa, encircling Qiao Jinyi within his protective circle. He smiled at the man on the other side: "Barron, long time no see."

Ou Muchong watched their intimate display, breaking the boundaries of propriety. Before he could even form an opinion, he noticed a slight resemblance between them.

The shape of their eyes was similar, and so were their noses. However, the boy was more handsome than Liang Jinwei, with smooth, soft facial features, a youthful glow from the abundance of collagen, and fuller lips.

Liang Jinwei was already strikingly handsome, and had a past of being labeled a "pretty boy" and mocked as a "young heartthrob" by middle-aged men. But compared to the boy before him, he appeared dashing and rugged.

“He’s Li…” Ou Muchong stammered, not only unable to recall Liang Jinwei’s brother’s name, but also somewhat unsure which brother this was.

Ou Muchong vaguely remembered interacting with Liang Jinwei’s fifth brother, Felix. Felix studied at an art academy and had once rented his art gallery for an oil painting exhibition; Ou Muchong had accompanied his mother to support him, appearing for half an hour.

He remembered Felix being far less handsome than the boy in front of him, and bearing no resemblance whatsoever. Besides Felix, the Liang family seemed to have another son, but he couldn’t recall his name.

Ou Muchong could only recall the gossip surrounding this man, who was extremely spoiled and had been exiled to Thailand for many years.

“He’s not.” Liang Jinwei denied it, then hesitated for a moment. He sensed the resentment in his younger brother’s eyes as he turned to look at him, and fearing the little rascal might cause trouble, he quickly said, “He’s my brother.”

“What brother?” Sure enough, Qiao Jinyi wasn’t fooled. He immediately started acting up, rudely demanding, “Someone you sleep with can be called your brother? What kind of brother am I to you?”

Liang Jinwei didn’t want to explain his complicated family situation to outsiders, but Qiao Jinyi had a volatile temper, and for a moment, his head ached.

Ou Muchong's gaze swept back and forth between the two men. Liang Jinwei, surprisingly, pretended not to hear such rude remarks and good-naturedly changed the subject, saying, "You were taking pictures, did you get the emerald you wanted?"

Ou Muchong answered for him, "Yes, but he doesn't have the money to pay, so I'll pay."

"How can that be?" Liang Jinwei's arm slid from the back of the sofa to Qiao Jinyi's shoulder. "Thank you, but no need for Barron's."

Ou Muchong understood Liang Jinwei's wariness and realized he was being seen as a lecherous man trying to seduce a young boy. He said with a hint of sarcasm, "But he warned me not to renege on the payment. How can I renege?"

Liang Jinwei's face turned ugly, and all his enthusiasm for smoothing things over vanished. Fortunately, Amber walked away... She greeted the two mature men, then familiarly squeezed past Liang Jinwei to sit next to Qiao Jinyi. While adjusting the computer, she said, "Let me see your spoils, hmm..."

Amber paused for a moment, then laughed and said, "You have good taste... Alright, wait for the harvest."

"What?" Qiao Jinyi exclaimed in shock, "You paid for me? Twenty million, Sister Amber! Twenty million, are you kidding me?"

Amber quickly covered his mouth. He mumbled a couple more times, then quieted down after realizing everyone's eyes were on him. Amber whispered in his ear, "If you shout again, everyone will know your brother wouldn't part with twenty million, be good."

Ou Muchong raised an eyebrow, uninterestedly picked up a glass of wine, and chatted with Liang Jinwei.

A few minutes later, Ou Muchong excused himself and left. Liang Jinwei looked at Qiao Jinyi with a gloomy face. Before he could say anything, Qiao Jinyi's eyes reddened, and he said in a tearful voice, "I didn't intend to spend twenty million. He encouraged me..."

Qiao Jinyi's voice trailed off. He wasn't sure if what had just happened counted as encouragement, but he felt that at least both sides shared some responsibility.

Spending twenty million wasn't a big deal for the Liang family's children. Liang Jinwei's second brother had bought a sports car in a fit of pique when he first arrived in Thailand and spent lavishly in nightclubs. His fifth brother had also invested countless sums in art and marketing.

They were all Liang Jinwei's half-brothers, and Qiao Jinyi shared the same mother. He didn't want to get angry over twenty million, especially since throwing that money in would at least yield an emerald bracelet, not a bail statement sent from overseas by a lawyer.

"Amber, they're still waiting for you over there," Liang Jinwei said, running his fingers through his hair.

Amber could tell from his expression that things were in trouble. She gave Qiao Jinyi a sympathetic look, patted him on the shoulder, and left with a helpless remark.

Qiao Jinyi tried to run, but Liang Jinwei grabbed his wrist and pulled him back. He lost his balance and fell back onto the sofa, preemptively shouting, "Why did you hit me!"

Liang Jinwei stood up, taking a menacing step towards him, and pressed his shoulder, whispering, "If I really hit you, you wouldn't even have a chance to question me."

Qiao Jinyi immediately fell silent. Liang Jinwei squeezed his shoulder: "No matter what happened, you at least need to tell me honestly. I'm your brother, so I'll cover for you, but what right does a stranger have?"

"He said..." Qiao Jinyi felt he hadn't explained things clearly enough. He should at least make Liang Jinwei understand that the man who said "twenty million" was the one who said it.

“Qiao Jinyi!” Liang Jinwei sighed. “How can you be so hopeless? Do I need to spell it out? He treats you like something that can be bought with money.”

“So what! How am I supposed to know if you’re willing to give me twenty million!” Qiao Jinyi was habitually self-righteous when angry. He shoved Liang Jinwei away. “You gave your brother a huge sum of money without even asking him when he wanted to throw a party. I opened two bottles of wine and you blocked my card, leaving me stranded and embarrassed. Did he drink less at his party than I did by myself? It’s all your fault!”

Qiao Jinyi pushed Liang Jinwei away and ran off, leaving Liang Jinwei with all eyes drawn by his outburst.

Liang Jinwei found it utterly incomprehensible. He had suspended his card because he saw Qiao Jinyi still at the bar at 2 AM; he was simply worried he might wander off and wanted his assistant to intercept him.

The estate was in the suburbs. Qiao Jinyi climbed onto the fountain pool and washed his face. A couple kissing nearby watched him jump off the 1.5-meter-high pool wall.

Qiao Jinyi wondered what they were exclaiming about, clicked his tongue, and walked away. He walked through the vineyard, his head aching from the mosquitoes buzzing in the vines, and irritably went to the parking lot, but couldn't find his car.

Remembering to call the driver, but unlucky enough to have forgotten his phone, a Ferrari flashed its lights at him from beside him, and a head popped out of the window asking, "I'm going to the city, do you need a ride?"

The estate wasn't open for business at the moment; everyone there was a friend Amber had invited. Qiao Jinyi glanced at the car and the gentle smile on his face, sniffed, mumbled a "Thank you," and got into the car.

Once inside, Qiao Jinyi couldn't help but feel sleepy. The driver handed him a soft neck pillow, and he drifted off to sleep.

When he woke up, he first felt dizzy. Opening the door, the overwhelming scent of perfume on the yacht assaulted his senses; the air seemed to be thick with alcohol.

Qiao Jin looked around blankly, and when he came to his senses, tears streamed down his face. He shrank back into his room and closed the door. Damn it, he felt like he'd been kidnapped.

He searched everywhere, finding a lip gloss tucked into the crevice of the cloud-shaped sofa. A satellite phone sat on the table. Qiao Jin picked it up and fiddled with it for a while, realizing he only remembered his mother's domestic phone number. But his mother had been arranged by Liang Jinwei to go on a trip to Norway.

Qiao Jin threw himself onto the bed to calm down for a moment. He felt sleepy again. He blinked and sat up. Suddenly, he heard footsteps outside, unsettling whispers, and a distant commotion.

Now that things had come to this, Qiao Jin also planned to go out and grab someone to ask what was going on. He had just pushed open the door when he was startled by a shout of "Don't move! Stand against the wall, hands on your heads, squat down!"

Uniformed police officers appeared. The yacht had already docked, and many intoxicated people were being asked to line up and leave. Qiao Jin, as one of the few who hadn't been drinking, was directed to a car.

"It's not him! Hey..."

"Don't move!"

Qiao Jinyi looked over at the sound and saw his driver on the other side. He excitedly explained to the police, "He was a hitchhiker. I was originally planning to take him to the city center, but he was asleep. I thought I'd make friends, and they kept calling me to come, so I had no choice but to bring him. Who knew he was sleeping so soundly..."

Someone turned Qiao Jinyi's face and examined him for a while, looking somewhat troubled. Then they lifted his chin to look at his neck. Qiao Jinyi, like a quail, dared not make a move.

He hesitated for a moment before saying, "I don't know what's wrong. I'm so sleepy. Could you call Liang Jinwei or Amber? I came from the Amber Wine Theme Resort... I feel a little dizzy."

Someone else came over and carefully examined Qiao Jinyi's neck and arms. Large rashes had appeared, clearly allergy symptoms, but because it wasn't certain, someone suggested taking him for a urine test.

Qiao Jinyi was completely bewildered. Hearing the words "urine test," he fainted, his eyes rolling back in his head.
