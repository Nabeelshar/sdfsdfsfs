Chapter 6 I'm Staying Here

Zheng Mingsen parked his car at the foot of the mountain and made a phone call. Looking in the rearview mirror, he could see Qiao Jinyi asleep again. She seemed to feel weightless from the car stopping; she shuddered slightly and opened her eyes groggily, like a frightened cat cautiously observing its surroundings.

Zheng Mingsen swallowed hard. A voice on the other end of the phone urged, "Jonathan?"

"I'm listening, okay." Zheng Mingsen hung up, turning back to Qiao Jinyi with a somewhat fierce look. "You just spent tens of thousands of yuan, didn't you?"

Qiao Jinyi couldn't help but whine, "I don't think I drank that much."

"You didn't drink that much, but you drank expensive things." Zheng Mingsen gave him a malicious look. "Since you can't afford it, I'll think of a way for you."

Qiao Jinyi didn't speak. In fact, he wasn't afraid. At eighteen, the isolation and bullying he experienced during puberty had already pushed him to the limit of despair.

Back then, he never imagined that at seventeen he would suddenly have an older brother who would be in the newspapers, living a life of luxury with the money his brother secretly gave him.

He didn't feel any danger whatsoever; instead, he had a narcissistic delusion that he was the protagonist of his own world, capable of turning every crisis into an opportunity.

Since the embarrassing experience of not being able to pay for a meal and then skipping out had already happened, he didn't think he would suffer any more blows to his pride. He could simply say he was Liang Jinwei's brother and threaten Liang Jinwei to pay for his drinks if he didn't want to embarrass himself in front of the media.

Thinking this way, he completely abandoned his pride and shame, and Qiao Jinyi even felt a sense of relaxed calm.

As the car approached a villa, Qiao Jinyi's gaze drifted past the lush trees, looking up at the modern-style building. Zheng Mingsen walked ahead, carrying two suitcases from the trunk.

Qiao Jinyi's gaze remained fixed on it, her steps slow as she followed behind. As they drew closer, they rounded a blind spot, revealing another French-style villa to the left, previously obscured.

The obscured villa appeared to be an older one, while the one next to it was likely a more recent work by the same designer.

A maid led them to the French-style villa. They waited for a while in the first-floor living room before the villa's owner entered through the back door, dressed in soft loungewear. He sat opposite them, first looking at Qiao Jinyi for a moment before fixing his gaze on Zheng Mingsen: "And you are?"

Qiao Jinyi hadn't noticed his gaze at all, instead looking at the beautiful crystal chandelier above. Hearing the voice, she looked down at the newly entered owner.

The moment Ou Muchong's eyes met his, he realized that the little rascal had completely forgotten about him.

Zheng Mingsen introduced himself solemnly, "I'm Zheng Mingsen, Zheng Ziye's younger brother. My brother sent me to deliver some things to you."

Ou Muchong's gaze then fell on Qiao Jinyi: "And him?"

The pent-up frustration in Zheng Mingsen's heart suddenly exploded. Ou Muchong's question made him incredibly regretful, a thought arising: "Even Ou Muchong cares about Qiao Jinyi's existence; what was I complaining about just now?" The affirmation from the superior dispelled Zheng Mingsen's unease, and Qiao Jinyi's beauty suddenly seemed unattainable.

Before Zheng Mingsen could answer, Qiao Jinyi nonchalantly replied, "He said someone here would pay for me, so I came."

"You really enjoy having others pay for you?" Ou Muchong tilted his head slightly, glancing at him.

"Huh?" Qiao Jinyi was taken aback by the question, but quickly convinced herself that the question meant he wanted something nice. So she earnestly replied, "I'm in a terrible mood, and I really want to drink. I'm willing to drink even if I don't have any money, but I'd be okay with getting beaten up afterward to vent my anger."

Ou Muchong remained expressionless, silent for a moment before asking, "So, what do you mean by coming here?"

"It means I'm going to stay here," Qiao Jinyi said matter-of-factly. "I used to be a pretty good dishwasher, but after drinking at a fancy bar, I just don't want to go back and smell the fishy smell of raw seafood."

Zheng Mingsen looked troubled. He had completely lost any possessiveness towards the handsome boy, inwardly cursing himself for what he had done—how dare he bring a plaything that Liang Jinwei didn't want to Ou Muchong like this?

Which of these two was someone he could afford to offend? If his brother found out, he'd be sent begging in his underwear.

"Alright," Ou Muchong said to the maid who brought tea and fruit, "Take him to settle in."

Qiao Jinyi obediently followed behind the maid, as if staying here was a given, nothing strange about it.

Zheng Mingsen, on the other hand, stared wide-eyed in surprise, unsure what to do with his hands, somewhat suspecting that Ou Muchong had sent Qiao Jinyi away to give him a scolding.

He subconsciously sized up Ou Muchong's physique. Ou Muchong's muscles were strong but not exaggerated, well-proportioned for his height. Such a physique looked good in anything, and even without clothes. Of course, Zheng Mingsen had no time to think about these things.

Ou Muchong had already turned his gaze away and was scrutinizing Zheng Mingsen, whose intense stare made Zheng Mingsen inexplicably nervous.

“Would you like to stay for lunch?” Ou Muchong made no attempt to question him.

“Uh… I won’t bother you any longer.” Zheng Mingsen stood up and asked uncertainly, “Um, is it alright?” He was naturally referring to the little boy he had brought.

Ou Muchong smiled faintly. “Give my regards to Leo.”

“Okay.” Zheng Mingsen didn’t dare say anything more, got up, and followed the servant out.

Qiao Jinyi was led to a suite on the second floor, on the west side. Opposite, on the east side, was another suite with a perfectly symmetrical layout. Between the two suites, facing south, was a sun-drenched living room and a large study. A row of German irises lined the north wall, with a high ceiling extending from the first floor to the third.

Seeing Qiao Jinyi staring at the excessively large chandelier, the maid earnestly lied to him, "These are all diamonds, priceless."

Qiao Jinyi's first reaction was that he was lying. A diamond that large would fetch a high price at auction, let alone a chandelier that big.

But after a moment's thought, it didn't seem entirely impossible for a place like Yujintan to have a chandelier made of diamonds…

Qiao Jinyi leaned over the stair railing, reaching for the hanging chandelier. Ou Muchong appeared behind him unexpectedly: "Be careful."

"Thank you…" Qiao Jinyi withdrew his hand. He asked simply, "Is this a diamond?"

Ou Muchong gave him a cold look, said nothing after him, and went into the room on the east side.

The maid glanced at Qiao Jinyi furtively. Qiao Jinyi nonchalantly returned to the room just assigned to him, kicked off his old sneakers, and ran barefoot into the bathroom to shower.

The bathroom had already been arranged by the maid. He showered until he smelled wonderful, then donned a bathrobe, leaving a trail of water stains on the carpet. He snuggled into bed and fell comfortably asleep.

When he woke up, it was already four in the afternoon. His stomach was growling with hunger, making him feel weak. There were no clothes in the closet, so he had to come out in his bathrobe. He heard voices coming from the living room next door.

He went over, and Ou Muchong, who had been drinking tea, got up and left. Several staff members who had brought clothes looked at Qiao Jinyi: "Sir, is it convenient to take your size now?"

Qiao Jinyi walked over somewhat bewildered, letting them measure him. A staff member in a skirt suit took several garments covered in dust bags from the hanger for Qiao Jinyi to try on.

“You’ll have to wait until next time to have a mannequin with a similar figure help you try them on,” the staff member said softly. “Which ones does the gentleman like?”

Qiao Jinyi was undecided when Ou Muchong, who had reappeared behind them, spoke up: “Keep all the sizes he can wear.”

“Yes, Mr. Ou.” The staff member kept half the clothes and took out several boxes, showing them the wallets, belts, cufflinks, and other decorative items inside. “This is a small token of our appreciation. We look forward to serving you again.”

Ou Muchong left even faster than the staff member. Qiao Jinyi took a white linen shirt and trousers back to wear.

The maid took the remaining clothes to the dressing room and came out to find Qiao Jinyi nestled on the sofa, lost in thought.

He wondered what his place was here. Ou Muchong's first act was to dress him up, so his role must be that of a lover, Qiao Jinyi hastily concluded.

He hurriedly stood up, walked past the maid to the bathroom mirror, ran his fingers along his cheek and chin, and muttered to himself, "I should be alright looking..."

Having washed seafood for almost a month, he didn't mind being someone's lover at all. All he wanted now was comfortable clothes, a life free from bullying, and ideally, spare money to buy jewels.

Thinking about it, he stamped his foot in frustration. He had known all along that Liang Jinwei wouldn't genuinely care about him, which was why he had bought so many jewels, but hadn't dared to take them with him at the time.

After all, in the public eye, he had no relationship with Liang Jinwei. Taking away a large amount of jewelry for no reason—if Liang Jinwei got angry and denied it, accusing him of theft would be the end of him.

However, this time it shouldn't be like that. Qiao Jinyi leaned against the sink. Being half-siblings was practically no problem, but being lovers was practically dating, wasn't it?

Thinking this, Qiao Jinyi pushed open the bathroom door and ran to the window. He knelt on the bay window. Outside were large trees blocking his view, and through the gaps in the branches, he could see a fenced-off flat area. Beyond the door was a quiet highway.

Compared to the days of constantly adapting to new environments and encountering strangers while traveling with his mother, this kind of mountain castle-like life made Qiao Jinyi feel relieved. “If only Ou Muchong could love me to death, and never tire of me…” Qiao Jinyi murmured softly, his hand gently resting on the glass. He made a decision he thought was incredibly clever: “But I must never fall in love with him.”

Not falling in love with anyone, not valuing anything highly—this was a self-protective mechanism he had built up based on his experiences.

Qiao Jinyi went to the restaurant on the first floor for dinner. The maid who looked after them at the villa was Ou Muchong's personal assistant, essentially the butler. She looked quite young, probably around Ou Muchong's age. This was the person who had told Qiao Jinyi that the chandelier was made of diamonds that morning.

While sipping his soup, Qiao Jinyi secretly observed the assistant arranging the bouquet. He noticed the assistant seemed to favor shirts with various lace trims, and changed his clothes frequently. This morning he'd been wearing a beige puff-sleeved shirt, but now he was in a pure white accordion-pleated one.

"What should I call you?" Qiao Jinyi asked.

The assistant slowly shifted his gaze to Qiao Jinyi's face, smiling, and said, "Mr. Ou calls me Evan."

"Then I'll call you Evan too," Qiao Jinyi said, feeling it necessary to cultivate a good relationship with this one of the few living people in the villa if he intended to stay there for a while. So he asked, "Or should I call you Brother Evan?"

Evan's smile became slightly strained. He softly uttered two words: "No need." He turned and grabbed a spray bottle to water the flower buds.
