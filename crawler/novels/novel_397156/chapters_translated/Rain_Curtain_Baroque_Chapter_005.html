Chapter 5 Yujintan Villa

Qiao Jinyi wanted a drink. Looking at the giant billboard in the distance, he remembered a bar nearby that he had been to before.

The bar's sign was a sharply defined "Night" character. It was located above a boxing gym, and only members were allowed in. Even without an invitation, even if the bar was deserted except for the staff, no one would be let in.

Qiao Jinyi had seen many of these perpetually loss-making bars since Liang Jinwei took him away. At first, he thought they were stylish, but later he found them rather boring.

He really wanted to drink, but he had no money. Although it was pathetic, the only way he could get a drink now was through Liang Jinwei's connections.

"Never mind," he thought to himself. "I'm heartbroken right now, what's wrong with having a drink?"

He lifted the Japanese-style curtain at the bar's entrance. A staff member quickly approached, but Qiao Jinyi ignored him. Just like when he'd seen Liang Jinwei enter, he went straight inside, found a seat, and said, "Just some drinks, and some fruit. Is Leo here?"

Sure enough, upon hearing his boss's name, the staff member flashed their signature smile: "President Zheng isn't here today. Shall we call him for you?"

"No need," Qiao Jinyi said, slumping onto the table, wondering why he hadn't left yet.

"Are you injured?" The staff member offered a considerate suggestion. "It doesn't seem like you're ready to drink. Would you like me to change it to..."

"I want to drink." Qiao Jinyi's tone was a little stubborn. He felt guilty for his slightly harsh tone earlier, but honestly, he was just cute; there was nothing wrong with him.

The staff member blinked and brought him several drinks. Qiao Jinyi drank the strong liquor like it was ice-cold beer, downing a glass in a few gulps. He frowned and complained, "It's so astringent. My tongue feels so tight after drinking it. Change it to something else."

The staff member, who had been harboring a bit of a vengeful thought, had no choice but to change it to a smoother drink, but the alcohol content was still very high.

There were women chatting nearby, but Qiao Jin was distracted and didn't listen carefully until a while later when she realized the voices sounded somewhat familiar.

"Why did you come back to China so quickly? Didn't you say you wanted to take a walk at dusk in a foreign country?"

"Forget it. I ran into a minor celebrity singing outside my hotel. I heard he's quite famous, surrounded by a huge crowd of fans. Someone even gave me flowers tied with banknotes. I thought it was novel, so I paid someone to send me two. Maybe because my gifts were of a larger value, his manager had a hotel staff member give me his contact information."

"Is he handsome? What happens next?"

"What can happen? He doesn't speak Chinese or English. I was added to a group chat. Those so-called managers are, to put it nicely, brokers; to put it bluntly, pimps. The group is full of rich fools." "That bastard, every now and then his stinky agent asks for gifts on behalf of his artists."

"Huh? Begging?"

"I can understand spending money to buy happiness, but does he think he's an emperor? That everyone's going to pay to fawn over him? What rich woman is so lowly as to act like a fish in a pond? And he's so clueless, knocking on my door at night, his makeup so thick he looks like a monkey that's fallen into a flour bin. My assistant chased him away, but you know what I mean? A completely white face through the peephole in the middle of the night..."

"Amber, you're so pitiful..."

Qiao Jinyi peeked over and, sure enough, saw Amber chatting with her female friend. Lemonade and hot cocoa were on the table; they seemed to be waiting for someone.

Qiao Jin hesitated, wondering if he should sneak away. Just as he made a move to get up, Amber, who was playing on her phone, suddenly looked up and said to her companion, "I'm leaving. I'm going back to keep my boyfriend company."

"Pfft…Amber, you're still the gentle, sweet type who goes to keep her boyfriend company?"

"What's wrong with me being gentle? What's wrong with me being sweet?" Amber chuckled. "My boyfriend and his younger brother are having a fight. His assistant says he's in a bad mood at work every day. I'm going to comfort him as a good deed."

"Which younger brother? The second one?"

"No, the youngest one." Amber had already grabbed her handbag and was walking out with her companion. Before they left, they heard another woman asking, "Is that Felix?"

Qiao Jin didn't hear Amber's answer. He had always refused to acknowledge Liang Jinwei as his older brother, but he felt a little sad when others said he didn't exist.

Qiao Jin also picked up his drink and chugged it down. His face clearly showed he wanted to get drunk when he ordered. The waiter gave him a 350ml Collins glass, though he'd actually preferred a large beer mug, but they didn't have those.

He downed half the glass in one gulp. The bartender muttered, "You should have gotten him an ice bucket for his drink."

Less than a minute later, the woman who had just left with Amber returned, sitting down and making a phone call: "Amber's gone. I'm waiting for you alone now. You'd better hurry, or I'll be going too. Um, she doesn't have anything urgent, just going to see William. They're so lovey-dovey. What's going on? I don't know, Amber didn't tell me."

After a brief exchange, the woman exclaimed knowingly, "William and his stepmother..." "My younger siblings are alright, who in this social class doesn't have to put on an act? It doesn't cost anything to fake brotherly affection, so naturally his siblings will be respectful to their older brother. 'Seeing someone with a beard means seeing their father,' so they have no psychological burden when it comes to acting cute and playful with their older brother. What's there to hold onto? Haha… Never mind that, hurry up and leave, I'll wait for you for five minutes at most."

The speaker meant no harm, but the listener took it to heart. Qiao Jinyi's face turned bright red. Felix and the others were Liang Jinwei's half-siblings, and he was Liang Jinwei's half-brother. Blood-related, no one was closer than the other. Those words were directed at him.

Feeling embarrassed and angry, Qiao Jinyi unknowingly drank himself into a stupor and fell asleep in his chair.

The lady next to him had left sometime earlier. A waiter thoughtfully brought him an air-conditioned blanket. His phone kept ringing; Chen Huiyi had sent him many messages, saying she had already scolded her brother harshly and that he should at least reply to let her know he was safe.

When Qiao Jinyi woke up, he saw the last message: "I won't call you, I'm afraid it will drain your battery, but you must call me back when you wake up."

It was now four in the morning the next day. Qiao Jinyi thought about what had happened last night and replied to Chen Huiyi: "I'm sorry, Sister Huiyi, for making you worry..." He paused awkwardly, then deleted everything he had typed.

He retyped: "I'm not going back. I'll contact you to hang out in a while." He added a thank you to his aunt and uncle for taking him in.

He put down his phone and looked at the empty glass on the table. A waiter approached him with a smile, "I didn't clean it up so as not to wake you. Would you like some soda water or watermelon juice to help you sober up?"

His mouth still felt bitter after drinking, and Qiao Jinyi was wondering how to pay the bill. Would it be too impolite to borrow money from Sister Huiyi?

"Make me a whiskey sour, lots of lemon, extra sour, extra sour!" someone strode in with a forceful air, shouting loudly.

The waiter told Qiao Jinyi to wait a moment and followed, even bending down slightly, following behind the newcomer with a very enthusiastic attitude.

Qiao Jinyi looked over as well. The young man, sporting a head of energetic spiky hair, wore a sleeveless T-shirt and knee-length shorts, radiating the warmth of sweat from an workout. He rushed to the bar and gulped down a glass of iced lemonade.

The waiter whispered something to the man, and then the man looked at Qiao Jinyi with a hint of curiosity in his eyes.

Qiao Jinyi had just woken up. His thick, soft hair was disheveled, and his exposed skin, from his face to his collar, was covered in red welts from drinking; he had a slight alcohol allergy.

The red spots looked like pale pink petals fallen on the flowers, making Qiao Jinyi appear like a fairy among them. The man thought of the dragonflies and butterflies he used to catch in the garden as a child—beautiful creatures with wings but no strength. Once he brought them into a human dwelling, they would cling to the French windows and balcony tables, barely clinging to life.

A young man with an alcohol allergy shouldn't be drowning his sorrows in a bar, just as a fragile flying insect shouldn't be flitting through man-made walls, chasing after glittering crystal chandeliers. A vibrant flowerbed is where its true splendor lies.

The man walked over to Qiao Jinyi, plopped down opposite him, and asked, "Who are you?"

Qiao Jinyi wasn't in a good mood: "I don't think it's anything to do with you."

The man smiled, glanced out the window, then turned back to Qiao Jinyi: "But you said you were looking for Leo."

Two months had passed, and Qiao Jinyi didn't quite remember Leo, but the man in front of him seemed somewhat similar. Qiao Jinyi composed himself, his attitude softening slightly: "You're Leo?"

The man smiled again, extending a hand. "Leo is my older brother. My name is Zheng Mingsen. You can call me Jonathan. Hello."

Qiao Jinyi realized from Zheng Mingsen's smile that he had revealed he didn't know Leo. However, Zheng Mingsen's self-introduction gave him confidence, so he said directly, "I don't have any money. You can ask Liang Jinwei for money, or I'll pay you when I have it."

"A free meal?" Zheng Mingsen raised an eyebrow. He had originally wanted to say, "I'll treat you," but after seeing the boy's fluttering eyelashes, he suddenly changed his mind and asked curiously, "Who is William to you? Why are you so sure he'll pay for you?"

"He is..." Qiao Jinyi remembered what Amber's friend had just said. He thought, "Yes, Felix and the others are Liang Jinwei's brothers. They share the same surname, attend social events together, appear in the media together, and the encyclopedia says they are brothers."

He was merely someone entrusted to Liang Jinwei by his mother, someone who couldn't even exist openly. He was always kept hidden away, and Liang Jinwei only introduced him vaguely to his girlfriend, Amber.

"Why ask so many questions? Anyway, he'll pay for me." Qiao Jinyi took a sip of the last drop of soup from his cup and asked anxiously, "Can I leave now?"

Zheng Mingsen glanced down at his sneakers. There was a stain left from dried soup on the surface. Zheng Mingsen pondered for a moment, thinking that this guy might be Liang Jinwei's plaything, and paying for his meal might be a way for the abandoned plaything to win back its owner.

Zheng Mingsen was immediately dampened. He got up and made a phone call, glancing at Qiao Jinyi occasionally while on the phone. By the time he hung up, his enthusiasm had completely vanished.

Qiao Jinyi was rubbing his face, seemingly uncomfortable from sleeping on it. His fingers were slender and beautiful, and his face looked very soft…

Zheng Mingsen felt a surge of inexplicable anger. He walked over to Qiao Jinyi and lied, “But William doesn’t seem to want to pay for you. He acted like he didn’t know you.”

Qiao Jinyi’s eyes widened, looking somewhat bewildered by the outcome.

He treated the troublesome young master with one attitude, and the abandoned, clinging canary with yet another. Zheng Mingsen, in a playful mood, said, "How about this? I'm going to Yujintan to deliver wine to Ou Muchong anyway. Maybe someone there will be willing to pay for it."

Qiao Jinyi was still a little dizzy. She silently repeated the name "Ou Muchong" to herself and, without much thought, followed Zheng Mingsen into the sports car.

What kind of place is Yujintan? Qiao Jinyi tried hard to remember but couldn't.
