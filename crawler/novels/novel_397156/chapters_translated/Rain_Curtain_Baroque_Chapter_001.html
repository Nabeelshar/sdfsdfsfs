<h1>Chapter 1: Asking Price of Twenty Million</h1>

Chapter 1 Bidding Twenty Million

Baroque Rain Curtain

A Pig Pushed the Door Open

The day after the rain, the sun shone brightly, and the air carried the fresh scent of earth and grass.

Qiao Jinyi lay comfortably in a blue and white checkered canvas chair, basking in the sun. Sunglasses perched on his nose, his eyes shining as he browsed the jewelry the auction house had given him.

A couple, behaving intimately, walked towards him, talking as they went. The man wore a light brown linen shirt and trousers. The woman wore a Tiffany blue long dress. She knelt down beside Qiao Jinyi as they approached, looking at the auction items together.

“I don’t like emeralds. If you’re giving them to me, then it’s unnecessary,” she said with a beautiful smile.

Qiao Jinyi frowned slightly, a hint of reproach in his eyes, then held up a finger and said earnestly, "Let Liang Jinwei buy it for you."

For Qiao Jinyi, seeing the Liang family on vacation was a real downer; even the beautiful jewelry lost its appeal. He turned off his tablet and tossed it onto the grass, then put on his sunglasses, intending to pretend to be asleep and use indifference to drive away the annoying intruder in his territory.

The person he disliked was his older brother, who had only appeared in his life a year ago. Back then, he was a high school student carrying a canvas bag and riding his bicycle to school. He'd finished his exams, licked an ice pop, and pushed open the door to find a handsome man in a suit looking up at him.

His mother was busy cutting fruit, and after several attempts, she finally spoke, "Qianqian, this is your brother."

The handsome man sitting on the sofa was Liang Jinwei. He gave Qiao Jinyi a subtle smile and elegantly uttered a few words: "My name is Liang Jinwei."

He only waited two seconds, and seeing that Qiao Jinyi didn't intend to acknowledge him, he casually prepared to eat the fruit his mother handed him.

Liang Jinwei first wiped the water stains off the fork with a tissue, doing so three times. This action somehow pierced Qiao Jinyi's heart. He suddenly jumped up and rushed over, punching and kicking his brother whom he was meeting for the first time.

His mother, an overly gentle and indecisive woman, tearfully tried to break up the fight between the two brothers, urgently explaining to him, "Qianqian, he's not from the Liang family. He's your brother, he's also Mom's son, don't be afraid..."

Qiao Jinyi had already been subdued by Liang Jinwei in a few moves. Qiao Jinyi's frame was slender and long; compared to Liang Jinwei's perfectly muscular physique, he had almost no strength to resist. He was pinned to the sofa, unable to move, tears streaming down his face.

Qiao Jinyi hadn't told anyone that he didn't actually mistake Liang Jinwei for another child of the Liang family. He had already searched for information about the Liang family members hundreds of times on encyclopedias; he was all too familiar with Liang Jinwei's arrogant, privileged air.

He simply hated Liang Jinwei. He and his mother toiled and suffered, while Liang Jinwei shone brightly on the Liang Group's official website, constantly updating one success story after another.

Liang Jinwei wasn't repeatedly wiping a fruit fork; he was wiping the grime and hardship of his and his mother's life.

Qiao Jinyi had his eyes closed. He sensed someone watching him, but there were no footsteps nearby. Just as he was about to lose his composure, someone pinched his cheek.

So he opened his eyes, staring at Liang Jinwei with a fierce yet timid expression: "What are you doing?"

"Xiaoyi, Amber is talking to you. Isn't it impolite not to answer?" Liang Jinwei pulled Amber's sun hat down onto Qiao Jinyi's face.

Amber, Liang Jinwei's girlfriend, was a woman with a strong presence. Her skin was a healthy tan, and her toned, muscular legs were visible when she wore a short skirt.

Amber removed the sun hat from his face, saying casually, "Xiao Yi answered. He said you should buy it for me. Don't pretend you didn't understand and miss the point."

Liang Jinwei gave a faint smile, picked up Qiao Jinyi's iPad, and handed it to Amber, saying generously, "Tell your assistant after you've chosen."

Amber had no intention of scolding him. She put down the tablet and chatted happily with Qiao Jinyi: "Do you like it here?"

This was a wine-themed resort built alongside a vineyard, Amber's private property, unrelated to her family's Huo family.

Qiao Jinyi's eyes followed the tablet to the grass. He asked her in a surprised tone, "He said he'd buy it for you, why didn't you take the opportunity to extort a large sum of money from him?"

Amber paused for a moment, then laughed along with Liang Jinwei. She patted Liang Jinwei, who was arranging picnic mats, and said with a smile, "You're not exaggerating at all."

Liang Jinwei gently sought her agreement: "Isn't it cute?"

Qiao Jinyi's face flushed instantly. He felt that Liang Jinwei must have been secretly mocking him for being materialistic, and probably often used him as a topic of conversation when dating girls.

Good heavens! He'd become a ridiculous fool trying to please the girl. Suddenly, Liang Jinwei no longer seemed so refined and elegant; in his imagination, her face had become cunning. Enraged, he yelled, "Liang Jinwei, are you sick?!"

"What's wrong?" Liang Jinwei asked calmly. "Is it not allowed to say you're cute?"

"I'm not a child anymore, don't talk to me like that," Amber said in a soothing tone, quickly changing the subject before Qiao Jinyi could get angry again. "Which one did you pick? Let's extort a huge sum from your brother, okay?"

Qiao Jinyi initially wanted to refuse with dignity, but the emerald cufflinks he'd just seen flashed through his mind, so he readily agreed, "I'll take it."

He gave up half of the recliner and they carefully browsed the auction items together, offering their comments. Amber was a mature and charming woman; she could easily bewitch Qiao Jinyi if she wanted to. Soon, Qiao Jinyi opened up to her, telling her everything he could and couldn't say.

After turning off the tablet, Qiao Jinyi even asked her, "Sister-in-law, don't marry my brother. Yesterday, he was helping his secretary zip up her back! It was so ambiguous, simply unbelievable. You have to keep your eyes open."

Liang Jinwei slammed the tray the waiter had brought onto the picnic mat. He looked up at Qiao Jinyi seriously: "Which side are you on?"

Qiao Jinyi was startled by his cold expression and didn't speak for a moment, just staring blankly back.

Amber found his quail-like adorable antics endearing and smiled, looking away from his gaze to comfort him, "William and I won't get married, it's okay."

"But aren't you two dating? I saw him kiss you after the party that day, in the parking garage..." Qiao Jinyi's voice trailed off, wondering if Amber would think he was a peeping tom.

Amber nodded, "Yes, we're dating, but dating and marriage are two different things."

"That's true, dating can end in breakups." Qiao Jinyi thought of his mother's early life, feeling even more disillusioned with love. He had initially been very optimistic about Liang Jinwei and Amber's perfect match, but now he turned his head away, heartbroken.

Seeing him even more heartbroken than himself, Liang Jinwei chuckled and nonchalantly picked up a mini hamburger.

Amber's heart melted at Qiao Jinyi's cuteness. Smiling, she explained, "William and I won't break up either."

Qiao Jinyi turned to look at her.

"It's just..." Amber thought for a moment, "William and I have been in love since high school, but in college, we weren't as inseparable. I confided in my mother, a medical doctor, and she told me from a biological perspective that this kind of exciting love can only last a few years, it will fade, or even disappear, just like how she and my father grew to dislike each other, only putting on a show of love for the media a few times a year."

Qiao Jinyi was completely captivated by her calm demeanor. This was a family trauma he still couldn't let go of, and Amber, this outstanding female warrior, described it all with a detached, observational tone.

“Based on my understanding of men, I have even less confidence in a rich and flamboyant CEO like your brother, and I’m the kind of lecher who can’t resist a muscular, handsome guy.” Amber winked at him. “So we swore an oath before Guan Yu to be each other’s most trustworthy partners, but marriage is out of the question.”

Qiao Jinyi glanced to the side at Liang Jinwei, who was calmly chewing his hamburger. He didn’t comment on his girlfriend discussing this kind of thing with his brother.

Until Amber said, “We trust each other more now. We date our own partners, and when we miss each other, we meet up for sex. It actually feels fresh.”

Liang Jinwei coughed; he choked on his hamburger.

Qiao Jinyi suddenly hugged Amber, pressing his face against hers. No one had ever talked to him about these things before, and he felt a surge of emotion, as if he were being treated like an adult.

Actually, he didn't know that Amber was guiding him like a child. She felt that Qiao Jinyi was practically a blank slate when it came to relationships.

Like when she was eighteen, she had already dated most of the handsome guys in high school. She had already tried every kind of charade: "pouring wine on her head for love" and "running in the rain shouting 'I love you'."

“Eric,” Amber said, gently pulling Qiao Jinyi’s shoulder, “You must cultivate a correct view of love. Don’t lie to others, and don’t be lied to. Be honest and clear about everything. The same goes for making friends; keep your eyes open.”

Qiao Jinyi nodded earnestly, “Okay, Sister Amber, I will.”

They ate delicious but unhealthy junk food together for lunch, and went drinking at the bar in the manor that evening. Afraid of embarrassing herself, Qiao Jinyi excused herself by saying her throat was sore and didn’t drink any alcohol.

Several young men came to chat with Amber. Afraid that his presence would affect Amber’s conversation, Qiao Jinyi considerately moved aside. Amber, even more considerate, had a waiter bring him a laptop and helped him connect to a phone so he could bid on the emerald cufflinks.

Qiao Jinyi stared at the details page, waiting for the emerald to appear. Before he could even finish reading a short line of text, the auctioneer's voice introducing the emerald necklace caught his attention—an item he hadn't noticed before.

A 15.21-carat Colombian emerald necklace, the chain set with numerous small yellow and blue sapphires and tsavorites.

Qiao Jinyi's gaze was instantly captivated. He adored this richly colored gemstone, even though many young people considered it old-fashioned.

He stared at the screen, admiring the necklace from every angle, not even noticing the sofa beside him sinking in.

When the auctioneer was almost finished with the introduction, mentioning the starting price of 8.5 million, Qiao Jinyi gasped.

A mature, deep, and persuasive male voice suddenly came through the phone: "Bid twenty million directly."

Qiao Jinyi was still in a daze, and hearing the commanding tone, he subconsciously obediently said into the phone, "Twenty million..."

When he finally came to his senses, the staff member holding the phone on the screen had already looked towards the price that had jumped to twenty million. The auctioneer smiled broadly and asked in both Chinese and English if there was a higher bid.

"Anyone bidding higher at 20 million?" The auctioneer's tone was elegant and melodious. "A 15.21-carat Colombian emerald as the main stone, anyone want to raise the price to 25.21 million?"

The staff member on the phone smiled at her joke, and the auctioneer chuckled as well: "20 million—" The hammer fell, "Sold!"

Author's Note:

----------------------

My new novel has started serialization! Thank you to all the new and old readers for your support! I originally planned to start "My Godfather is Nine Thousand Years Old," and I had tens of thousands of words saved up. However, I've already written four ancient BL novels, and I really, really, really wanted to write a modern BL novel. And then a pair of characters came to mind: an innocent and straightforward beauty as the bottom, sometimes charming and cute, sometimes so clever it seems you can see into her heart. The story revolves around a reclusive gentleman living in a secluded villa on a hillside. He's taciturn and aloof, but his attention is drawn to a vibrant and beautiful young woman, stirring his emotions. And thus, the story of this novel began.

Aside from a brief period of deliberation about where to begin the opening, a considerable portion of the novel flowed smoothly. It's fair to say that while I was writing one scene, the next related plot points would already be popping into my head. As I typed, I was constantly worried these inspirations would slip away, so I frantically jotted down these fragments. By August 6th, when I confirmed that serialization would begin the following morning, the novel had nearly 300,000 words in drafts.

I've very happily written a fantasy novel, hahaha!

Daily updates, mostly around 3,000 words per chapter in the early stages, with longer chapters later on.

Hope you enjoy reading! Thank you for reading this series! *kiss* [heart emoji] [heart emoji] [heart emoji] [heart emoji] [heart emoji] [heart emoji] [heart emoji]
