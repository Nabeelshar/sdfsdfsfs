Chapter 8 I Can Win the Argument Myself

Evan's tone was earnest: "No one dislikes you, but if you wet the stairs and don't want to clean them, you should at least tell me. Luckily, it was just me who tripped and fell. Uncle Lin is too old to take a fall, Mr. Ou..."

"What are you saying?" Qiao Jinyi stormed downstairs, but Ou Muchong grabbed her wrist: "Be careful."

"I tripped here just now, I didn't hold the cup properly and it fell." Qiao Jinyi told Ou... Mu Chong explained, "Evan saw it just now, and he even spoke to me. It's not that I didn't tell him. Of course, I'm not saying it was wrong of me to spill water, I just..."

Ou Mu Chong's gaze fell on his slightly red knees, gently interrupting him: "Did you fall?"

Qiao Jin Yi was stunned. His attention was entirely focused on explaining the situation clearly, nervously and urgently trying to deliver his defense, but Ou Mu Chong interrupted him.

He neither scolded him for clumsily spilling water, nor followed Evan's lead in blaming him for not warning others.

Instead, he asked if he had fallen. Qiao Jin Yi felt a pang in his heart; he blinked, and his nose gradually stung with tears.

"Does it hurt?" Ou Muchong held out a hand to him, a thought flashing through his mind: perhaps at his age, it shouldn't be called naive, but rather innocent and ignorant.

Unbeknownst to him, Qiao Jinyi's image had transformed from a foolish, pretty face back into an innocent and charming little prince.

His tears didn't fall from his eyes, but they dripped into Ou Muchong's heart.

“Mr. Ou,” Evan said softly, “I’m fine. If you’re going downstairs, please take the stairs over there.”

Ou Muchong ignored Evan, raised his hand, and gently wiped Qiao Jinyi’s lower eyelid with his fingertip. But Qiao Jinyi wasn’t actually crying. He looked at Ou Muchong somewhat blankly. Ou Muchong said to him, “Go back first.”

Qiao Jinyi subconsciously obeyed and took a few steps. When he remembered he still had an argument with Evan, he had already missed the tense moment, so he took a deep breath and went back to his room.

He washed his face and nestled on the sofa, savoring Ou Muchong's concern. Suddenly, sadness welled up again. He felt that any child who had always had their emotions properly accepted wouldn't have felt such heartache over a simple "Does it hurt?"

He became angry again, blaming himself for not arguing more forcefully, for not being more organized, for not making Evan cry his eyes out.

Two knocks came from the door. Qiao Jinyi turned away and mumbled, "You can come in."

The door opened softly, and a moment later, someone sat down beside him, sinking into the soft sofa. Qiao Jinyi tensed up warily.

"I've already talked to him," Ou Muchong said, as if coaxing him, but his tone was very casual.

This reminded Qiao Jinyi of Liang Jinwei. Their conversations were always so calm, making it easy for Qiao Jinyi to see through their feigned indifference and coldness.

Elegance and politeness were the soft armor of the upper-class "gentlemen," effortlessly shattering others' self-esteem and pretense, revealing their true nature of inferiority and uncertainty.

"You don't need to talk to him; I can win the argument myself," Qiao Jinyi said, raising her sharp quill.

Ou Muchong was annoyed by the previous act, but Evan had worked there for five years, rarely making mistakes and never overstepping any boundaries.

Just now, Ou Muchong dismissed Qiao Jinyi and walked step by step across the wet carpet to Evan, casually asking, "Wool carpets aren't slippery when wet, Evan. I don't want to do something like checking the soles of other people's slippers."

Evan immediately fell silent, his eyes widening. Ou Muchong immediately understood his reaction, leaving him with the words, "You'd better watch yourself."

Qiao Jinyi's straightforward anger and grievance made Ou Muchong feel relieved. "I can have Evan apologize to you."

Just an apology? In Qiao Jinyi's mind, Evan was already dead. At the very least, he should be fired to vent his anger. He didn't want to have to face someone who had schemed against him all the time.

“No need.” Qiao Jinyi turned around, unable to contain his anger towards Ou Muchong. His eyes were red and watery, like a vibrant flower glistening with dew.

Ou Muchong thought to himself, he really is excessively handsome, and also quite amusing.

Having received no reply from Ou Muchong, Qiao Jinyi angrily got up and went to the bathroom. While showering, he muttered to himself that Ou Muchong was out of his mind, refusing to even fire the lying housekeeper.

Besides, he had clearly stated that it wasn't necessary. If Ou Muchong truly felt apologetic, he should have automatically increased the stakes, such as, “Then should I make him leave here forever?” But Ou Muchong didn't say anything.

After showering, Qiao Jinyi stood in front of the mirror, pondering what to say to Ou Muchong. If Ou Muchong still had that poker face, he would simply ignore him; he absolutely wouldn't initiate a conversation.

Upon opening the door, he found Ou Muchong had already left. On the four-petaled, light yellow coffee table sat a plate of sliced fruit, a dish of cream, and a dish of pistachio jam.

Qiao Jinyi felt a little better. He sat on the sofa, playing mobile games and eating fruit as he went. Before he knew it, it was almost midnight, and he heard the sound of a car outside.

Qiao Jinyi ran to the window but could only see the lush foliage of the trees. Who would come to a place like this in the middle of the night? Curious, Qiao Jinyi left the room.

There was conversation in the entryway downstairs. Evan spoke in a tone even more rude than when he'd spoken to him, "Mr. Ou is already resting. You should wait until tomorrow..."

"Who do you think you are, daring to stop me?"

Qiao Jinyi leaned against the railing and waited for a while, but received no reply from Evan. He inwardly despised Evan's cowardice.

After a while, Uncle Lin's voice came again: "Second Young Master, you should know what time it is. Isn't it impolite to come knocking at this hour?"

"This is my home. I grew up here. What's wrong with me coming home?"

Ou Muchong's door opened. Qiao Jinyi turned around. Ou Muchong, wearing pajamas, walked indifferently to a spot not far from Qiao Jinyi, without saying a word.

Uncle Lin's tone was stern: "Second Young Master, do you even remember how many years it's been since your family moved out after your grandfather's death and the division of the family property? The eldest son inherited the old house, and after his death, his son inherited it. The lawyer knows these things better than an old man like me."

"Don't try to intimidate me with your lawyer!" the newcomer said with extreme hostility. "Ou Muchong is a cold-blooded beast who only cares about profit. Does he have any family ties? He doesn't even respect his uncles and elders? And he wants to ride roughshod over my father?"

"Second Young Master, don't shout." Something knocked. Uncle Lin continued, "If Mr. Ou truly disregards family ties, the Second Young Master wouldn't be allowed in. And please, Second Young Master, don't forget your manners. It would be too embarrassing if I had the bodyguards come in to escort you."

"You old codger, you're just a servant! Don't think you're someone important just because you've been in the Ou family for so long. How dare you talk to me like that? Tell Ou Mu Chong to get down here! He didn't even come out to greet his cousin. Who taught him to be such a coward?"

Qiao Jin also secretly glanced at Ou Mu Chong. The latter remained indifferent, quietly listening to the intruder's rude remarks, finally revealing a hint of mockery and disgust at the end.

Ou Muchong went back to his room to call his bodyguard. Before he even reached the door, he heard hurried footsteps coming down the stairs. Turning around, he only caught a glimpse of Qiao Jinyi's fleeting back and a few strands of hair sticking up, fluffy like a dandelion.

Qiao Jinyi stood on the last step, addressing the figure arguing with Uncle Lin, "Who are you? Why are you yelling in someone else's house? Don't you have a home at this hour?"

Evan, standing nearby, turned around, a smirk playing on his lips, as if watching a good show.

The arrogant man raised his head, hands on his hips, and turned around, revealing a greasy face, glaring angrily at Qiao Jinyi.

He was a little overwhelmed by Qiao Jinyi's arrogant aura, and he thought carefully about which young master the child standing condescendingly on the stairs belonged to. He looked familiar, but he couldn't remember it.

"I'm Ou Muchong's cousin, but who are you?" The man sneered hesitantly and tried to test his momentum: "Don't you recognize me, Ou Yaomei?"

"Why should I know you?" Qiao Jin also sneered.

Ou Muchong stood on the stairs, not showing himself. From his angle, he could see Qiao Jinyi's beautifully contoured profile. Her chin was slightly raised, her jawline taut, and her fingers fidgeted nervously on the handrail. Ou Muchong took in these subtle, timid details, but from a distance, she still maintained a commanding presence.

Ou Yao's sunbeams throbbed with anger. He shoved Lin Bo aside and walked over. Ou Muchong noticed Qiao Jinyi's tightening grip on the handrail.

"If you dare touch me, you'll regret it." Qiao Jinyi looked at Ou Yaomei, who had stopped in front of her, and said very sincerely, "Can't you stay away from me? Your sweat smells disgusting."

Ou Yaomei had gotten out of the car at the foot of the mountain and climbed up, and he had drunk a lot. He had taken a taxi to this place, but the driver refused to get in, so he could only walk, grumbling and cursing. Every mosquito that saw him had a good meal.

“You fucking…” Ou Yaomei frowned. If a burly man had said these words to him, he would have simply cursed and moved away. But it was Qiao Jinyi who spoke, and in his eyes, Qiao Jinyi was just a helpless, human doll to be toyed with at will. He couldn't help but want to fight back, but before he could, he noticed a figure high up.

It was Ou Muchong, whom he hadn't seen in a long time. This made Ou Yaomei somewhat stunned. Although he was angry that his vast family business had fallen into Ou Muchong's hands, he couldn't act arrogantly in front of President Ou simply because he was his cousin.

Ou Muchong's gaze was cold, looking at him as if he were looking at a vicious dog.

Ou Yaomei snorted coldly. He had come up the mountain panting all evening, not to be scared away in disgrace, but to vent his anger, even if things got really heated.

“Go back, ignore him!” Qiao Jinyi turned around and said, “He reeks of alcohol and is disgusting.”

Ou Muchong took a moment to realize that Qiao Jinyi was talking to him. The unexpected emotion left him speechless, and he simply stared silently at the little guy blocking the stairwell.

“Who the hell are you calling disgusting…” Ou Yaomei hadn’t finished speaking when Qiao Jinyi slapped him.

Qiao Jin also lashed out, still arguing, "I wouldn't be angry if you mentioned my father even once, get out of here!"

Ou Yaomei was stunned by the blow. Based on Ou Muchong's understanding of him, this was a prelude to a reckless rage. Physical violence was the least of his worries. If there wasn't a robust legal system here, he could easily blow this place up with a bomb. Clearly, relying solely on his own moral restraint wouldn't work. He was a classic example of someone who had only grown older but not more mature, a good-for-nothing spendthrift.

Ou Muchong finally spoke, calmly drawing the fire: "Eric, come over here. Don't waste your breath on rude stray dogs, or you'll get bitten."

Ou Yaomei immediately yelled and lunged at Ou Muchong: "Fuck your mother! You're the stray dog!"

He had just stepped onto a step when Qiao Jinyi shoved him, but due to the weight difference, Qiao Jinyi didn't push him away; instead, she... He slumped backward onto the stairs, shouting to cover his embarrassment, "Get out of here! I'm afraid of being contaminated by your stench if I fight you..."

Before Ou Yaomei could launch his indiscriminate attack, Ou Muchong lifted Qiao Jinyi by his armpits and gently pulled him to his side, coaxing him softly, "Sweetie, I know you want to protect me, but trash like him isn't worth your time."
