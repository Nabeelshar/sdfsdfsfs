Chapter 3 Periosteal Contusion

Qiao Jinyi was conscious for a while, then unconscious again. He only remembered being taken to a place where someone made him urinate and urged him to do so quickly. Then someone gave him an IV drip. Finally, he heard Liang Jinwei and his lawyer's voices.

In the afternoon, Qiao Jinyi finally woke up in the hospital. Sitting next to him was Liang Jinwei's assistant, Vincent, who told him about the events of the past day.

The car he was in belonged to a friend of Amber's. The friend mistook him for a male companion and genuinely intended to give him a ride to the city, but on the way, the friend kept urging him to hurry up and go have fun.

So, Qiao Jinyi was taken to the beach by Amber's friends, who were eager to go out and have fun. These friends, all of whom had just been drinking, couldn't resist taking Qiao Jinyi, who was asleep in the back seat, and insisted on bringing him along, just to make friends.

Then, these "lunatics" carried the still-conscious Qiao Jinyi onto the yacht. Everyone found this story unbelievable, but it was only after checking the security footage that it was confirmed to be true.

Only after hearing this did Qiao Jinyi recall being moved while he was in a daze, but at the time he thought it was a dream and didn't pay much attention.

As for being asked to dock by the police, that was a different matter altogether. Apparently, some wealthy young man on the yacht had offended someone and was falsely accused of overdosing on illegal drugs.

Qiao Jinyi's rash was due to an allergic reaction, unrelated to medication, but rather to phthalates. According to the car owner, it was likely because a bottle of perfume had been sprayed on the back seat recently, and Qiao Jinyi, wearing light clothing, had a large area of skin in contact with the leather back seat.

By noon, it was proven that Qiao Jinyi was perfectly fine; it was a complete misunderstanding. Qiao Jinyi gasped, earnestly assuring Vincent, "I will never get into a stranger's car again."

"Eric, you should talk to President Liang about this," Vincent said with a detached, polite smile. Since Qiao Jinyi was brought back by his boss, he had already dealt with many of the young master's troubles.

Last year, Qiao Jinyi was a rebellious and arrogant minor, spending his days arguing with his boss and sulking, his handsome boyish face always downcast as he told everyone to leave.

Although difficult to deal with, Vincent at least had ways to handle him. This year, however, Qiao Jinyi, whether instigated by someone or simply having a change of heart, is spending money lavishly, almost as if seeking revenge.

Vincent's initial surprise turned to horror when Qiao Jinyi spent seven million in Southeast Asia one weekend. Vincent's first thought was, "Oh no, I'm doomed. Has he been tricked into gambling? That guy's already over eighteen!"

Fortunately, Qiao Jinyi only bought a lot of worthless stones. Two days later, Vincent picked him up at the airport, a heartbroken Qiao Jinyi.

Vincent was momentarily stunned by the young master's handsome appearance before he could utter his stern words, and instinctively offered a reassuring "It's alright."

Immediately afterward, he felt utterly doomed. Cleaning up the mess for a spendthrift playboy and providing him with emotional value—this was far too degrading for a working-class person.

And Qiao Jinyi lived up to his expectations, completely indulging in colorful gemstones, spending a fortune every few days. The only improvement was that she stopped going to the shady jewelry markets and started going to reputable places with after-sales guarantees.

Vincent placed the square, flat box, its outer packaging just removed, on the bed. "This was sent by the auction house. Mr. Liang asked me to give it to you."

Qiao Jinyi opened the box. A beautiful emerald necklace, the yellow and blue sapphires on the chain surprisingly complementing each other perfectly.

Vincent watched him drape the necklace over his wrist. His slender, fair wrist suited it perfectly, like a mysterious little prince rarely seen from a castle.

"Does it look good?" The little prince, having forgotten the trouble he'd just caused, asked with a beaming smile, as if seeking praise. Anyone could tell he was incredibly happy.

Vincent hesitated for a moment, then nodded restrainedly, inwardly complaining that he couldn't tell his boss's brother it didn't look good. What was there to ask?

But the little prince's joy was short-lived. The old prince burst in, throwing a crumpled stack of hospital receipts at Qiao Jinyi's face, and launched into a tirade: "Are you brainless, or do you have some kind of pre-sleep fantasy about being played by men? Did I come to you too early, delaying your dream from coming true?"

Qiao Jinyi was stunned by the outburst. Even the worldly-wise Vincent felt his boss's scolding was excessive, but these things were none of his concern, so he simply quietly left the room, closing the door behind him.

"Qiao Jinyi, there's definitely something wrong with your head," Liang Jinwei said, sitting down on the single sofa next to him. He unscrewed a bottle of water, took a sip, and then irritably tossed it into the trash can.

Qiao Jinyi, just regaining his senses, blushed. His initial shame about yesterday's experience vanished after Liang Jinwei's scolding, leaving only anger and a desire to take Liang Jinwei down with him.

"You're the one who's out of your mind!" Qiao Jinyi pulled out the IV. His movements were quick and fierce, startling Liang Jinwei, who instinctively got up to restrain him.

"Get away from me!" Qiao Jinyi completely lost his temper, pushing against Liang Jinwei. "Don't touch me!"

"What did I say wrong?" Liang Jinwei shoved him onto the bed. Although he was certain the mattress was soft, he still heard a thud.

Seeing the needle marks bleeding from Qiao Jinyi's hand, Liang Jinwei's tone finally softened: "You did something wrong, and I, as your brother, can't even handle saying a few words to you? Getting into a stranger's car and being transferred to a yacht without even realizing it—is that something an adult should do? If you hadn't encountered a bunch of brain-dead rich kids, but kidnappers, would you still be alive to yell at me like this?"

Qiao Jinyi, tears streaming down his face, got up and lunged at Liang Jinwei, grabbing his collar. Liang Jinwei remained motionless, letting him hold on.

"Do you know how awful your words were?" Qiao Jinyi's voice trembled with tears. "Who do you think you are? You're not my mother, what right do you have to yell at me? You even said...you said that to me, is it because you fantasize about being..."

Liang Jinwei held back for a long time, but finally couldn't help slap her. In his rage, he didn't even know how much force he used. When he came to his senses, he found that Qiao Jinyi was already stunned.

Qiao Jinyi's skin was pale, her eyes were big and round from crying, making her look especially pitiful. The tip of her nose was also red, and her full lips trembled as if she had suffered a great injustice.

Liang Jinwei's heart softened for only a moment before he imagined something far worse. What if things had gone terribly wrong today? His handsome yet foolish younger brother might end up in another man's bed, or worse, in some run-down warehouse reeking of men's stench.

Being slapped by his older brother was already a stroke of luck. Thinking this, Liang Jinwei's anger flared. He coldly glared at Qiao Jinyi: "You're right, I'm not your mother, and you're not my child. So what right do you have to spend my money? Do you think it's my honor to control you?"

Qiao Jinyi's ears were ringing, and he couldn't hear a word Liang Jinwei said. He could only see Liang Jinwei's coldness and disgust.

Liang Jinwei seemed to say a lot, but Qiao Jinyi couldn't understand it. Only the last sentence, though Liang Jinwei's lips moved very slowly, conveyed the meaning to Qiao Jinyi: "Fine, I don't care about you anymore."

Liang Jinwei left.

After a long time, Qiao Jinyi finally burst into tears. He ran out and grabbed a nurse, who took him for an examination. The results showed a periosteal contusion, and he was prescribed painkillers and antibiotics.

The allergic rash on Qiao Jinyi's body had faded to faint marks. He left the hospital carrying a bag of medicine, his left cheek severely swollen and red, attracting frequent stares.

He didn't return to the apartment Liang Jinwei had provided. Vincent messaged him saying the card had been deactivated and he would receive 3,000 yuan a month for living expenses until Qiao Jinyi showed interest in studying. Liang Jinwei would then help him prepare for studying abroad.

After finishing his second year of high school, Qiao Jinyi was suspended by Liang Jinwei because his grades were too poor to get into university within a year. Amber considerately said that the changes of the past year would be difficult for Qiao Jinyi to process in a short time, and there was no rush to return to school; it was better to let him adjust to the sudden change in his living environment first.

Vincent casually asked him a junior high school question, and Qiao Jinyi couldn't answer it. His mother said he barely made it into the second-worst high school by 0.5 points, and every day his backpack only contained a water bottle and a carton of milk; he couldn't even find a pen.

The thought of studying gave Qiao Jinyi a headache; he knew Liang Jinwei would call him an idiot again.

Starting in junior high, Qiao Jinyi's mother, Qiao Lilan, moved frequently with him. Qiao Jinyi's grades were initially quite good; he would win awards in exams and use his prize money to buy gifts for Qiao Lilan.

Qiao Jinyi was not only a good student but also well-behaved. He was always popular at school because of his clean and good-looking appearance. However, after transferring schools, he was isolated because of his introverted personality and inability to understand the dialect.

After several more school transfers, Qiao Lilan remained unaware of her negligence, but was shocked by her son's drastic personality change. The relationship between mother and son deteriorated rapidly.

Qiao Jinyi couldn't even remember the last time he studied properly, and he strongly resisted returning to school.

He returned the three thousand dollars to Vincent, carried the medicine, and walked along the road for a long time until dusk. He went into several restaurants that didn't look very upscale, and finally chose one where the cashier was a woman with short, permed hair, and the staff were all family members. He asked if he needed anyone to wash the dishes.

The short-haired woman sized him up for a moment, then said enthusiastically, "We need you. You can be a waiter, and my daughter can handle the cashier. I'm getting old, and my eyesight isn't good."

The woman with a ponytail came over, looked at Qiao Jinyi, and said with a smile, "If you're willing to come, I'll give you the cashier position. Business will definitely be good if you manage our storefront."

Qiao Jinyi felt a little relieved. He said softly and politely, "I'm a little hard of hearing right now, so it's inconvenient for me to handle the cashier position. I still want to wash the dishes."

The short-haired woman had already noticed his flushed cheeks. She went to the freezer, got some ice cubes, put them in a plastic cup, and gave them to him. Qiao Jinyi felt a little awkward, and even a little like crying. He lowered his head and didn't say anything more.

The chef, an uncle with a slicked-back bald head, came out and looked him over. The short-haired auntie said to him, "Keep him, he looks so cute."

Qiao Jinyi was assigned to do odd jobs in the kitchen. He was a little clumsy, but the owner's family didn't mind. The short-haired auntie even offered to give him half of the upstairs storage room to live in, so Qiao Jinyi didn't complain about the wages.

He just wanted to heal his hearing first, so that working as a cashier later might be easier.
