<h1>Chapter 4: Departure</h1>

Chapter 4: Departure

The shop owner was a short-haired auntie surnamed Chen. She had divorced when she was young and had a daughter and a son. The older sister with a ponytail was her eldest daughter, named Chen Huiyi. The younger brother, with dark skin, was named Chen Ruoliang, a little younger than Qiao Jinyi. He only came to the shop to help on weekends.

The chef was Aunt Chen's older brother, whom Qiao Jinyi called Uncle, just like his siblings.

The shop's main ingredient was seafood. Qiao Jinyi got up at five o'clock to help Chen Huiyi scrub seafood shells. After only three days, his hands were too sore to hold chopsticks, so he was reassigned to odd jobs.

Qiao Jinyi hadn't had much of an appetite these past few days and ate very little, so Aunt Chen felt bad about assigning him more work. Privately, she told her daughter that seeing the little guy's fair skin and young age, he had probably run away from home after a fight, and would be found and brought back sooner or later.

Aunt Chen advised her daughter not to get angry with him, saying that maybe his family would come looking for him, remembering how they had helped their son, and generously book a banquet at their shop.

Chen Huiyi laughed at her mother's naiveté, but assured her she wouldn't get angry. Actually, she was very kind but a bit blunt. Occasionally, seeing Qiao Jinyi dragging his feet and not getting out of bed, she couldn't help but yell at him a few times, but once downstairs, she would give him steamed eggs and tell him not to eat seafood while his hearing wasn't better.

After more than half a month, Qiao Jin felt his hearing had fully recovered, but just to be safe, he took antibiotics for two more days.

When he went out to throw away the seafood trash, he threw away the remaining medication as well. Standing next to the trash can, he couldn't help but marvel at how long he had persevered. He felt incredibly gratified; although his mother no longer cared about him, at least he could eat.

Qiao Jin charged his phone and turned it on. He had expected many calls and messages, but there were only some notifications from auction house and jewelry store members, and a message from Vincent from half a month ago: "Tell me if you run out of money."

Besides that, there was no comment on the returned three thousand yuan. Qiao Jin put his phone away, somewhat disappointed.

If Liang Jinwei were to search the world for him, he would definitely say, "Don't come. I don't need your help." But Liang Jinwei didn't contact him, and he felt really angry.

He confided his feelings to Chen Huiyi, who scrubbed the oyster shells noisily, commenting, "You're just too childish, a little kid at heart, just trying to get attention."

Qiao Jinyi retorted fiercely, "I'm not!"

"Whatever, as long as you truly believe it yourself," Chen Huiyi said, picking up a large basin to empty the sink.

Qiao Jinyi sat on a low stool, taking a few deep breaths, before going to the front to help take orders.

It was Friday. His younger brother, Chen Ruoliang, came home with his canvas bag and sat at the innermost table, diligently doing his homework. Aunt Chen poured milk into a glass and asked Qiao Jinyi to take it to him.

Qiao Jinyi said sourly, "Why pour it out? Just use the cardboard box and a straw to drink it."

Aunt Chen wiped the milk droplets off the counter with a cloth. "A glass is prettier, and it makes you feel better when you drink it."

"Tch..." Qiao Jinyi slammed the glass down. Chen Ruoliang, who was doing math problems, was startled. He looked up and saw it was Qiao Jinyi, so he smiled good-naturedly. "What's wrong? Do you want some?"

"No!" Qiao Jinyi went into the kitchen to pick scallions. Soon after, Chen Ruoliang finished his homework and came in to help him.

Chen Huiyi called to her younger brother, "Come help me shake the scallops."

"I'm picking scallions for him." Chen Ruoliang didn't move, but smiled ingratiatingly at Qiao Jinyi, flashing his bright white teeth. Qiao Jinyi snorted, "No need, you go wash the scallops." It wasn't that he willingly wanted to pick the scallops alone, but he was afraid that if Chen Ruoliang didn't go, Chen Huiyi would make him wash the scallops.

He struggled to lift that huge basin, and after a couple of shakes, he wanted to throw it away. He didn't know where Chen Ruoliang got his strength.

The summer rain came quickly, and the house was damp and cold with the air conditioning on. Qiao Jinyi hadn't finished picking the scallops after Chen Ruoliang finished washing them. He had thought Chen Ruoliang would come to help him, but Chen Ruoliang left the kitchen after finishing the scallops.

Qiao Jinyi pouted and threw the withered yellow scallion leaves on the ground. Chen Huiyi, knowing his lazy nature, turned away and chuckled.

Qiao Jinyi sneezed. A dark shadow blocked the light from the rear ventilation window. Chen Ruoliang draped his uniform jacket over Qiao Jinyi.

“It smells of smoke, take it away.” Qiao Jinyi sniffed in disgust. “I’m going to tell Aunt Chen you’re secretly smoking at school.”

“No, I was just keeping watch for them.” Chen Ruoliang pressed down on his coat, which Qiao Jinyi had almost shaken off. “Wear it properly, or you’ll catch a cold and have to take medicine. I remember you pinching your nose when you took antibiotics.”

“They asked you to keep watch for them?” Qiao Jinyi frowned immediately, lowering his voice to question him. “Are you being bullied at school too? I’ll take you to school next Monday.”

“No.” Chen Ruoliang was a little confused, and after thinking for a moment, asked him, “Who else was being bullied? Did someone come to the store to cause trouble?”

“…” Qiao Jinyi held a handful of… Xiao Jinyi tossed the scallions to Chen Ruoliang: "No, pick them yourself. I'm going to rest for a while."

Now, during the break between lunch and dinner, Qiao Jinyi chose a seat further inside. He lay down on the hard sofa, covered with Chen Ruoliang's coat, and was just about to fall asleep when he heard Uncle Chen standing at the cashier complaining, "He comes out to work and sleeps all day. I want to dock his wages."

Aunt Chen scolded, "If you have nothing to do, go out and clean the trash can by the back door. I haven't said anything, why are you complaining?"

Qiao Jinyi got up from the sofa and silently walked to the hard sofa near the door, pretending to be waiting for customers. His uncle saw this and didn't say anything, but after being glared at by Aunt Chen, he obediently went back to his hiding place in the kitchen.

Qiao Jinyi had only turned on his phone last night and couldn't resist playing with it for a while. Today, he was so sleepy he felt like he could fall asleep at any moment. He sat for a while, then, seeing his uncle wasn't there, lay down again.

He slept fitfully, half-awake, when he heard someone open the door. He didn't have the energy to get up and greet the guest, and seeing no one call him, he went back to sleep.

After some time, it sounded like someone was standing above him, chatting. They sounded like students, saying things that were typical of the vulgarities of adolescence.

"Is he a girl? He's so handsome! If you take him to the bar street tonight, someone's definitely going to try and slip you money."

"Bullshit! If anyone's going to slip money, it'll be to him. What girl would like someone like me?"

"What? You mean girls like him? You're really not on the right track. I'm talking about men. If a man likes him, he'll be the one giving you money. You're always grinning like a pimp! Hey! Chen Ruoliang, you dare hit me? What's wrong? You don't like me talking about him? Seriously? You don't have a crush on him, do you? I was wondering why you kept mentioning that guy who came to your house…"

"Shh...why are you getting louder? What bullshit about a crush? It's just that he's a pretty boy, a spoiled brat, he has no manliness at all. Sometimes I even dream about him as a woman."

"Hahahaha...so honestly, do you want to sleep with him? Say it, don't play dead."

"...Yes."

"Haha..."

"Hehe..."

Qiao Jinyi's chest heaved violently. He thought about how kind Aunt Chen was to him, and how kind Sister Huiyi was to him. If he argued with Chen Ruoliang now, he would definitely be kicked out, and then he might not be able to find a place to stay and eat.

Don't be angry, don't be angry. Qiao Jinyi told himself, then suddenly sat up and slapped Chen Ruoliang across the face.

"Ah!" Aunt Chen shouted from behind the cashier, "Huiyi, come quick and pull them apart! They're fighting!"

Chen Huiyi ran out. Qiao Jinyi was being punched under the table by Chen Ruoliang's friend. Chen Ruoliang grabbed his friend's waist and forcefully pulled him away, then pushed open the door, chased him out, and locked it behind him.

"Eric..." Chen Huiyi pulled Qiao Jinyi out from under the table. Surprisingly, Qiao Jinyi didn't cry. He was wearing Chen Ruoliang's old T-shirt, loose and faded from washing, revealing most of his shoulder. His lip was cut, his cheekbone was broken, and his eyes were staring at Chen Ruoliang.

Chen Ruoliang felt a momentary pang of heartache, followed by a rapid, pounding in his chest. He looked at the old clothes Qiao Jinyi was wearing, thinking how much better it would be if Qiao Jinyi were lying on his bed—it would be much more comfortable to hug than a pillow.

"How are you?" Chen Huiyi glared at Chen Ruoliang. "Why don't you protect your own people?"

Chen Ruoliang was momentarily stunned. "I..."

"You coward..." Chen Huiyi shoved Chen Ruoliang away. "If I had muscles as big as yours, I'd beat that guy to death... No, I can't stand it!"

Chen Huilin got up, grabbed the U-lock of the tempered glass door, and ran out. Aunt Chen jumped up in fright. "Stop your sister! She's going out to fight someone!"

Qiao Jinyi reacted even faster than Chen Ruoliang, forcefully shoving Chen Ruoliang's shoulder and chasing after her. Chen Huiyi was chasing after a high school student in uniform. The boy kept looking back nervously as he ran, and passersby were all staring at them.

Chen Huiyi yelled "Go to hell!" and threw the U-lock in her hand, hitting the boy squarely on the back. The boy cried out in pain but didn't dare stop to argue, running away without stopping.

Qiao Jinyi stood there watching Chen Huiyi, who had stood up for him, and suddenly burst into tears. Chen Huiyi yelled at his retreating back, and an aunt next to her nudged her arm, saying, "Your little brother is crying."

Chen Huiyi turned around, and Qiao Jinyi wiped his eyes and walked away. Chen Huiyi knew he was in a bad mood and probably wouldn't come back this time, so she quickly chased after him, saying, "What are you doing? Who's going to do the work if you leave? Come home quickly, I'll have Chen Ruoliang buy you some sweet soup to apologize."

Qiao Jinyi was pulled back into the shop, where Aunt Chen and Uncle Chen surrounded him, offering words of comfort. Uncle Chen promised he would never say he slept during the day again, and Aunt Chen poured milk into a tall glass for him. Only Chen Ruoliang hid behind, too afraid to speak.

Aunt Chen said she was going to make him shark fin soup, and Uncle Chen also hid in the kitchen, letting the children comfort each other.

"Don't get in the way here. Go buy some sweet potato soup, two bowls. We'll eat, you watch," Chen Huiyi shooed Chen Ruoliang out.

Chen Ruoliang left, turning back several times, his mind preoccupied with how to apologize, or when this would be over if he didn't apologize. He also had to spare some energy worrying about how to handle things between friends back at school.

"Sit down for a bit, I'll go get the medicine," Chen Huiyi patted Qiao Jinyi's shoulder and went upstairs.

Qiao Jinyi glanced at the tall glass of milk beside him, a slight chuckle playing on his lips. Suddenly, the pain shot through him, and he dared not move. He picked up the glass, drank the milk, and then quietly left without saying goodbye to anyone.
