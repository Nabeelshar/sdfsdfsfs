Chapter 7 A glass of water was brought over…

Qiao Jin didn't say anything more. After finishing his food, he left the restaurant. At the top of the stairs, he saw Ou Muchong coming down. Ou Muchong seemed to ignore him, showing no intention of speaking.

Qiao Jin felt strange. Allowing a stranger to stay in his home so casually, yet being so indifferent to him—what kind of habit was this? Ou Muchong's demeanor didn't seem like that of a carefree fool. Qiao Jin could only associate him with a strange, perverted person.

Qiao Jinyi tentatively asked, "I think I offended Evan. Do I need to apologize to him?"

Ou Muchong stopped and turned to look at him. "What did you do?"

"I didn't do anything." Qiao Jinyi turned completely to face Ou Muchong. He thought for a moment, "Maybe I was too polite. Should I have been bossy towards him?"

A flicker of curiosity crossed Ou Muchong's face, but he quickly regained his indifference, looking at Qiao Jinyi coldly without saying a word.

Qiao Jinyi pursed his lips, gave a soft hum, and went upstairs. Only when he reached his room did he feel a little scared. Had he been too disrespectful to his host? After all, he was now just a parasite who depended on his master for food and clothing.

But Ou Muchong's reaction really annoyed him. He said nothing, completely ignoring his feedback and feelings, as if he didn't care about him at all.

Qiao Jinyi lay on the bed for a while to calm down, worried that Ou Muchong would be angry. Ou Muchong's reaction probably showed he favored Evan over him, since they were the ones who spent every day in this villa.

But Evan actually used a large sprayer to water the flowers while he was eating. Qiao Jinyi remembered that his seat was right where he could see the water molecules drifting in the air through the window light, some of which landed on the plate on the table.

The more Qiao Jinyi thought about it, the angrier he became. He punched the pillow twice, then buried his face in it and sulked for a while.

*

In the restaurant, Ou Muchong finished a salad. Evan brought over a steak, but was stopped as he was about to leave: "Evan."

Evan stopped. "Mr. Ou?"

"Did he offend you?" Ou Muchong put down his cutlery and looked at Evan.

Evan looked puzzled, his eyes darting around as if he were thinking seriously. "Mr. Ou, I don't understand what you mean."

"He's very young, and his personality isn't very mature." Ou Muchong casually moved the side dishes on his plate. "If you don't like him, just talk to him less, but don't give him a hard time, and don't point fingers at him."

"I didn't, Mr. Ou." Evan's eyes were a little flustered, and he took a step forward eager to explain.

Ou Muchong gently pushed the plate forward a little. "That's good."

The chef leaned out from behind the island, his hands on the counter. Seeing Ou Muchong pass Evan and leave, the chef approached and asked, "Should the desserts continue baking?"

Evan rubbed his temples, his face and tone cold. "You bake yours. Whether Mr. Ou eats them is his business."

The chef watched Evan's retreating figure and gestured with his lip. Thirty minutes later, he placed the baked desserts on the island, picked up a scone, took a big bite, patted his protruding belly, and put it back. Before the remaining desserts could even be placed on the dessert counter, he had already collected them all into a tray.

"It smells so good."

The chef turned around. Qiao Jinyi walked in, carrying a badminton racket. "What delicious food did you make?"

"Desserts." The chef thought for a moment, then picked out the undamaged desserts from the tray and placed them on the birdcage-like dessert table in front of Qiao Jinyi.

Qiao Jinyi tossed the badminton racket on the floor, washed his hands, sat down, and picked up a light-colored butter pastry. He ate it intently, and the chef couldn't help but wait for his evaluation.

"It's a bit salty." Although Qiao Jinyi didn't particularly like it, she still ate the remaining half in one bite. "I don't really like things too salty."

The chef pointed to the brown cake: "You could try the walnut cake, but without chopped walnuts, and not as sweet. It's been modified according to Mr. Ou's taste."

Qiao Jinyi smiled, cut a small piece of the walnut cake without chopped walnuts; the sweetness was just right, not too cloying. He nodded. "This is delicious, just a bit dry."

The chef, seemingly unperturbed, enthusiastically pointed to the canelé. "Then I recommend you try this."

"Next time," Qiao Jinyi replied, wanting to express his determination to stay for a long time. He picked up a whole walnut cake, as big as his palm, took a bite, and asked, "Would you like to play badminton? The weather outside is great, not completely dark yet, and there's no wind."

Because it was their first meeting, and his suggestion came rather suddenly, the chef didn't refuse, nodding. "Sure, as long as you don't mind my poor skills."

Qiao Jinyi, while eating his cake, picked up a racket from the floor and handed it to him. "What should I call you?"

"Manager Ou, my name is Uncle Lin," Uncle Lin said, taking the racket.

They played badminton for a while in the open space outside. Uncle Lin was very skilled at it, and seeing Qiao Jinyi's slender arms and legs, he wanted to give him a workout. He cleverly hit the shuttlecock to both sides, and Qiao Jinyi, after being outmaneuvered for over half an hour, was panting heavily, yet still managed to hit the shuttlecock back at Uncle Lin.

By the end, Uncle Lin felt a little guilty. The two sat on the steps, watching the distant mountains swallow the last rays of sunlight. Uncle Lin sprayed him with mosquito repellent.

Qiao Jinyi was sweating profusely, his shirt soaked. He smoothed his hair back, revealing a clean forehead. Brushing his bangs back, his handsome features became even more defined, his eyebrows and eyes incredibly delicate.

“Your parents must both be great beauties,” Uncle Lin said to him.

Qiao Jinyi had never met his father. As for his mother, she had always had wrinkles since he could remember, and she was always quiet and seemed unhappy.

Qiao Jinyi didn't speak. As if sensing something, Uncle Lin changed the subject, saying, “Have you been exercising for so long? We still have a lot of desserts left.”

They moved back to the restaurant. Qiao Jinyi stood in front of a table, one knee bent on a chair, elbows propped on the table as he selected desserts that interested him.

When Ou Muchong arrived, he saw the handsome young man, wet with sweat, a piece of butter pastry in his mouth, his hands poking around on a piece of bubble wrap.

Uncle Lin came out of the kitchen: "Would you like some milk tea? It's a recipe I've had for over twenty years, very… Mr. Ou."

Qiao Jinyi turned around, saw Ou Muchong, and lowered her knees from the chair, asking, "Would you like some?"

"Did you fall into the lake?" Ou Muchong's gaze fell on her red knees, the marks left from kneeling on the chair. Her legs were straight and long, slender calves and slightly fuller thighs, with smooth, fair skin.

Qiao Jinyi felt herself being scrutinized and said somewhat irritably, "No."

"Bring me a glass of water." Ou Muchong turned around, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed. He felt uneasy because the image of an animal's teeth tearing at Qiao Jinyi flashed through his mind.

Qiao Jinyi poured a glass of water and brought it upstairs. He walked slowly, still wondering as he climbed the stairs if he had misunderstood—perhaps Ou Muchong had actually positioned him as a servant?

Suddenly, Qiao Jinyi tripped and fell. The upper half of the old villa's stair railing was intricately carved walnut wood, while the lower half was in the style of Roman columns. In a panic, Qiao Jinyi grabbed the railing to avoid falling, but the water glass rolled down the stairs, thankfully escaping the carpet.

Evan appeared downstairs, his face expressionless, and asked, "What are you doing?"

His tone was unfriendly. Qiao Jin had no experience dealing with domestic help; when he lived with his mother, they couldn't afford a maid. After Liang Jinwei took him in, the nanny who looked after him was very kind and warm-hearted, and would never speak to him in such a tone.

Qiao Jin was a little angry, but remembering that he was just freeloading, he didn't say anything. He silently poured another glass of water and brought it up. Evan stood beside him without saying anything, but it was clear he was very upset.

No one answered the door to Ou Muchong's room. Qiao Jinyi gently pushed it open and glanced inside. The layout was exactly the same as his current room, but the decor was mainly light gray, clashing drastically with the classic and luxurious style of this villa—it was like opening a door connecting two worlds.

Qiao Jinyi quickly withdrew and then knocked on the study door. The person inside seemed to have been looking around the small living room, noticing the water dispenser on the smart table in the corner…

?

Qiao Jinyi immediately perked up. Hearing Ou Muchong invite him in, he walked in with a smile. Ou Muchong looked at him quietly, his expression unreadable, but certainly not one of pleasure.

It was obvious that the boy before him was incomparably handsome, but not exactly intelligent. “Put it down.” Ou Muchong looked away and said coldly, “Get out.”

Qiao Jinyi’s smile vanished instantly. He was surprised that Ou Muchong didn’t thank him. What an annoying guy.

His initial admiration for Ou Muchong’s wealth and good looks vanished instantly. Qiao Jinyi felt that the man sitting behind the table wasn’t doing anything productive; he was just putting on an act.

Qiao Jinyi let out a soft “tsk.” Just as he opened the door, a cry of pain came from outside.

“What happened?” Qiao Jinyi felt a surge of worry. He quickly went out and saw Evan lying on the ground at the bottom of the stairs. Uncle Lin also ran over to help him up.

Evan glanced at Qiao Jinyi without speaking, his gaze seemingly looking away from him.

Uncle Lin tried to help Evan up several times but couldn't. He asked worriedly, "Did you fall somewhere and can't get up?"

"I'm fine, Uncle Lin." Evan looked away, slowly standing up while holding onto the handrail, then looked at Qiao Jinyi with a pitiful expression: "Why is there water on the stairs?"

Qiao Jinyi was about to say, "Didn't you see me fall here?" when Ou Muchong's voice came from behind him: "Are you hurt? Should we call a doctor?"

"No, it just hurts a little." Evan took an awkward step, then stopped, holding onto the handrail again.

Qiao Jinyi realized that Evan seemed to be targeting him.

"I think I'm being disliked," Qiao Jinyi whispered.

Ou Muchong followed his gaze to the bewildered Evan.
