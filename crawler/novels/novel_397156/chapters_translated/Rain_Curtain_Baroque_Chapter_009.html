Chapter 9 How about twenty carats…

The flustered Qiao Jinyi was instantly calmed down. He hadn't felt any fear earlier, controlled by his adrenaline, but now, held protectively in Ou Muchong's arms and calmed down, he felt a lingering fear.

Instinctively, Qiao Jinyi hugged Ou Muchong's waist and buried his face in his chest. This feeling of being able to rely on him gave him a highly addictive fear, so he once again followed his instincts and pulled away from his embrace.

Because of his struggle, Ou Muchong looked at him with some confusion. He avoided Ou Muchong's questioning gaze and pretended to be nonchalant as he turned to look at Ou Yaomei, who had fallen and sprawled on the stairs due to being too drunk.

"They're here, they're here." Uncle Lin seemed to breathe a sigh of relief.

Four tall men entered through the back door. They were imposing, but opened and closed the door quietly. They quickly stepped forward and pinned Ou Yaomei down.

Ou Yaomei had just gotten up when he was pushed down again, his face pressed against the stairs. He couldn't help but vomit.

Qiao Jinyi couldn't bear the disgusting scene and went upstairs, bypassing Ou Muchong.

He didn't go back to his room but sat down in the small living room. The adrenaline hadn't completely subsided. He sat down and stood up repeatedly, then sat down again. After several repetitions, realizing his heart was beating too fast, he forced himself to sit still.

He drank some water. As Ou Muchong passed by, he caught a glimpse of him out of the corner of his eye and stopped to speak to him: "Were you…?" Ou Muchong paused, changing "Were you scared?" to "Were you disgusted?"

Qiao Jinyi nodded in agreement: "He smelled awful."

"He won't have a chance to come in again." Ou Muchong sat down on the sofa next to him, intently tracing Qiao Jinyi's appearance with his eyes.

He hadn't expected Qiao Jinyi to stand in front of him. He could tell that Qiao Jinyi wasn't trying to please him, but was simply angry, his vibrant emotions clashing with the atmosphere.

Although Qiao Jinyi wasn't trying to please him, Ou Muchong was definitely pleased.

He reached out to Qiao Jinyi, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed, before uttering a few low words: "Sit here."

Qiao Jinyi's restless fighting spirit was instantly crushed by his aggressive gaze. He hesitated, looking at Ou Muchong.

"Come here," Ou Muchong repeated, this time softly and slowly, with a sense of pressure, yet strangely lingering.

Qiao Jinyi sat down somewhat timidly, keeping a fist's distance from Ou Muchong. Ou Muchong smoothed his messy hair with his fingers, then affectionately touched his flushed, hot cheek—the touch was delicate, soft, and bouncy.

For two years, Ou Muchong silently watched as his "relatives" would occasionally trespass into his territory, pointing their fingers at him and hurling insults. Aside from the paid bodyguards, no one else would actually step in to shield him with their bodies.

Actually, Qiao Jinyi wouldn't do that, nor would he chase them away. He needed a beautiful little pet who wouldn't scheme against him, to keep his life from becoming too dull.

And the little pet's emotional intensity—getting angry and upset over every offense he suffered—almost made him laugh out loud.

“I’m not actually angry,” Ou Muchong told him. “I’m even a little happy. If I want you to be happy too, what should I do for you?”

Qiao Jin thought for a moment. “Could you give me a property?”

Ou Muchong hadn’t been unaware that he would ask for something, like beautiful gemstones—something he’d always liked. This was an unexpected answer.

“A house?” Ou Muchong asked.

Qiao Jin nodded deeply. “Yes, anywhere is fine, but I don’t want to move. I just want a house.”

The constant moving with his mother over the years had caused him great pain, but he couldn’t bring himself to resent her. He could only attribute his isolation and bullying to the moving.

He thought that if he had a house, he could live there permanently without constantly adapting to new environments. He could retreat inside and avoid all the hassle of socializing.

But this request was like a lion asking for too much, and Qiao Jin looked at Ou Muchong with some trepidation.

"Okay," Ou Muchong agreed readily, without asking why he wanted a house. "What are your requirements for the house? I'll have someone prepare it and bring it to you for signing."

Qiao Jin felt like he'd been hit by a pie falling from the sky. More than happy, he was bewildered. He thought, "To actually exchange my appearance for real money? This is simply too amazing!"

Ou Muchong narrowed his eyes. Qiao Jinyi's every reaction was unexpected. He didn't seem happy to get what he wanted; it was more like a test, a probe to see if Ou Muchong would give it to him.

"Who exactly are you?" Ou Muchong asked him.

Qiao Jinyi was a little confused: "What...who do you mean?"

"Nothing." Ou Muchong gently turned his head, quickly planting light kisses on his cheeks. He stood up and patted his shoulder: "Get some rest."

Qiao Jinyi was still a little dazed. He raised his fingers to touch his burning cheeks, then realized Ou Muchong hadn't left. He turned his head and saw Evan standing beside the living room.

Qiao Jinyi's attention was diverted again, and he was instantly ignited: "Do you know how useless you are? You just stood there watching him go crazy. At least you should have told him to get out and let him know he's not welcome!"

Evan had already lost his composure, just standing there letting him criticize him, looking rather pitiful.

Qiao Jinyi walked past Ou Muchong to stand in front of Evan: "Why are you looking at me like that? It makes me look like a bad guy, doesn't it?"

Uncle Lin interrupted them halfway down the stairs: "Alright, stop arguing. Evan, go back and rest. You two separate quickly, don't huddle together."

Evan turned around helplessly and softly retorted: "I didn't..." as if he were saying he was being wronged. He wasn't trying to argue with Qiao Jinyi, but rather that Qiao Jinyi was being unreasonable on his own.

The old man couldn't understand why they were at each other's throats; he just wanted to end the argument. The best thing to do at night was to sleep; what was there to argue about?

Evan looked hurt. Uncle Lin hesitated for a moment, then intervened through Qiao Jinyi: "Come here, I can't thread a needle. You're the youngest, so your eyesight should be the best. Come here, hurry."

"Okay, I'm coming." Qiao Jinyi obediently ran over and followed Uncle Lin downstairs.

Evan said to Ou Muchong in a very weak voice, "I'm not good at arguing, you know that."

His words sounded like a plea for comfort, but Ou Muchong showed no sign of politeness, nodding coldly, "It's late, you can go downstairs."

Evan watched Ou Muchong leave, but didn't know what to say. Having worked with him for years, he knew his boss's temper well. If he said anything more, Ou Muchong would definitely think he was nagging, a nuisance.

"Oh, right," Ou Muchong stopped, and the gloom in Evan's eyes instantly vanished, replaced by a bright and cheerful look.

Ou Muchong felt a slight annoyance at the inappropriate expectation in his eyes, but didn't dwell on it. "If you can't even handle an intruder, you'd better memorize the bodyguards' numbers. I don't want to see stray dogs rushing up to the second floor. A few barks from the first floor is already my limit."

Evan looked ashamed. "I understand. I'm sorry."

The next day, when Qiao Jinyi woke up, only Uncle Lin was in the restaurant. He was a little surprised to see him. "I thought only old men like me would wake up this early."

"I woke up hungry." Qiao Jinyi ate breakfast alone, then took two honey croissants and a cup of black tea upstairs. He sat down at a small table by the window on the north side, looking at the lush green scenery outside, and contentedly sipped his warm black tea.

Ou Muchong sat down opposite him, casually taking another croissant, and said lightly, "Uncle Lin's tone wasn't exactly polite, but you actually listened to him quite a bit."

Qiao Jinyi replied, "Of course, I'm very tolerant of those who cook for me."

Ou Muchong ate quickly, taking a bite out a third of the croissant each time. When he finished, Qiao Jinyi still had half left.

Ou Muchong couldn't help but laugh under Qiao Jinyi's scrutinizing gaze. Qiao Jinyi looked at him like he was a hungry wolf, even slowing down his chewing.

"May I go to your study?" Qiao Jinyi felt a little bored. He wasn't a big fan of sports, so he had given up playing badminton with Uncle Lin. The scenery outside was beautiful, but he was afraid of encountering snakes and didn't dare go out.

Ou Muchong led him into the study, spacious and simple, with most of the wooden furnishings in a brownish hue, matching the style of the villa and appearing untouched by alterations.

On the bedside table sat a cup of cold red tea and a copy of Nietzsche's *Zarathustra*. Qiao Jin imagined Ou Muchong sitting there reading.

Then, passing by, he leaned against the window, looking at the road outside, and said softly, "It's so quiet here, no cars are passing by."

"Because that road you see is my private property," Ou Muchong said casually, as if he were saying, "That little wooden stool by the door is my private property."

Qiao Jinyi was taken aback. He had no idea that a road could be privately owned. He walked up to Ou Muchong, placed his hands on the table, and asked, "Where does it go?"

Ou Muchong put down his phone. "From where Zheng Ziye stopped to make a call when he brought you here, all the way to the villa, that road is mine."

"You're so rich!" Qiao Jinyi praised generously.

Ou Muchong's mood subtly improved. Qiao Jinyi's tone wasn't jealous or longing, but simply pure praise. Ou Muchong had been influenced by him to believe that owning a road was a very impressive thing.

“Give me a kiss.” Ou Mu Chong’s Adam’s apple bobbed. “Then you’ll become very rich.” He pointed to his cheek, his voice low and seductive. “A kiss here will do.” I’m not greedy, nor am I shy about coveting you; you’re too beautiful.

Qiao Jin thought for a moment, then poked Ou Mu Chong’s cheek with his finger and asked, “What will I get if I kiss you here?”

“What do you want?” Ou Mu Chong asked him.

“I want…” Qiao Jinyi thought to himself as he wrapped his arms around Ou Muchong’s neck, “You’re so rich, I think if I kiss you here, I should at least get a pretty stone in return.”

A pretty stone meant an expensive gemstone. Ou Muchong understood his meaning and indulged his greed: “You probably like emeralds, how about twenty carats?”

Qiao Jinyi’s eyes widened slightly. He simply sat on Ou Muchong’s lap and, before Ou Muchong could react, kissed him on the lips without hesitation.

His kiss lasted a little longer than a “light touch,” actually because he didn’t know what to do next. While Ou Muchong wanted to deepen the kiss, he had already decided to just end it there.

So Ou Muchong only had time to lightly kiss his lips, and Qiao Jinyi felt a moment of soft moisture, instantly blushing slightly.

His behavior was charmingly naive and innocent, unlike any teenage boy in this world.

Under Ou Muchong's burning, dangerous gaze, he fearlessly negotiated: "If I kiss you here, I can at least get thirty carats, right?"
