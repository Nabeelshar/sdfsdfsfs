Chapter 10 Why Not Thirty…

Qiao Jinyi quickly received a Colombian emerald brooch, 28.88 carats, delivered personally by the designer, who explained, “This emerald has excellent clarity. I drew seven or eight designs. I originally planned to use smaller diamonds to complement it, but Mr. Ou said you might prefer colored gemstones. He suggested rubies and sapphires, but I felt the results were less than satisfactory…”

The designer picked up his masterpiece: “So I threw all the previous designs into the wastepaper basket and chose to design a floral setting. Isn’t it beautiful?”

“Why isn’t it thirty carats?” This was the only thing Qiao Jinyi cared about.

The designer paused, uttering a slightly puzzled "Huh?" However, he quickly composed himself. "There was also a 33-carat slightly oiled Colombian emerald, but its color wasn't as rich as this one. Mr. Ou chose this one mainly because 28.88 is a lucky number. Honey, you can't judge a beautiful stone by its carat weight alone; its price is also affected by its clarity and color. Trust me, the one you have is very valuable."

"Okay." Qiao Jin didn't bother to examine the designer's proud floral setting design. He put the brooch back in its box, gave a perfunctory thank you, and took the emerald back to his room.

Because he was missing two carats, Qiao Jin was too saddened to appreciate the emerald's beauty, and slumped over the coffee table, spinning the jewelry box. The loosely secured brooch jingled and bounced around in its box.

Ou Muchong knocked twice on the door and then entered. He sat down on the carpet, just like Qiao Jinyi. "They said you don't like it?"

Qiao Jinyi replied listlessly, "I like it."

"Not necessarily," Ou Muchong raised an eyebrow, pulling Qiao Jinyi closer by the waist.

Qiao Jinyi showed no interest in responding, so he turned and asked, "When can you take me to see a house?"

Ou Muchong paused. He knew Qiao Jinyi's desires and thoughts were blatantly undisguised, but asking about a house the very next moment after receiving the gemstone seemed rather disappointing.

Ou Muchong almost blurted out, "You're so vain and materialistic!" But then he realized this was precisely his opportunity to get closer, so why make things difficult with harsh words?

So Ou Muchong said nothing. Even though Qiao Jin only loved those beautiful and expensive stones, he was hopelessly captivated by her appearance.

Her warm, delicate skin and full, moist, rosy lips fueled his fantasies. Last night, he even dreamt of embracing a beauty. He'd forgotten most of the details, but the soft touch felt as real as if it had actually happened.

“If you want, you can go now,” Ou Muchong asked him. “Want to go?”

Qiao Jinyi didn’t jump up excitedly as Ou Muchong expected. Instead, he remained silent for a moment before softly saying, “Okay.”

Ou Muchong squinted as he watched Qiao Jinyi walk into the dressing room; his back view even gave the illusion of a sense of dejection.

Qiao Jinyi made no secret of his longing for jewelry and real estate, yet he casually tossed the emerald he had just acquired onto the table.

Ou Muchong opened the box and glanced at it. The emerald brooch shone brightly on the velvet cushion, but he felt that the emerald was too intense and somewhat dull. Perhaps he should give him gemstones of different colors.

Thinking of this, Ou Muchong tapped his fingers lightly on the table. He felt that the past two years had been incredibly boring.

In fact, he wasn't completely isolated while living here; he just rarely appeared in the media. If his old friends contacted him, he was still willing to maintain appearances.

For example, Amber had been messaging him for several days, suggesting he get some fresh air, and he actually did. His life wasn't really boring.

On the contrary, it was Qiao Jinyi who felt bored. He saw hardly anyone here; even Lin Bo and Evan combined weren't as talkative as Chen Huiyi. He was so idle that even his daily routine had become regular.

So he decided to use looking at houses as an excuse to go out and have some fun. Looking at his face in the mirror, he didn't look like someone old enough to afford a house.

He took off his T-shirt and changed into a white shirt. As he picked up his casual suit jacket, he felt he'd overdone it, so he hung it back up and put on a beige cashmere cardigan.

The white shirt conveyed seriousness, while the cashmere cardigan was relaxed and casual. When Ou Muchong looked up and saw the person who came out, he felt as if the light in his eyes had brightened.

"Go," Ou Muchong said, getting up and leaving. He felt inexplicably down. He called his assistant, his last words being, "Keep an eye on him. Don't let some random person fawn over him."

Ou Muchong's assistant, Alex, was a young man with black-rimmed glasses, a thin build, slightly sunken cheeks, and a shrewd and rational demeanor.

He smiled and opened the car door for Qiao Jinyi. Once inside, he sat silently in the passenger seat, his face etched with business.

Qiao Jinyi thought he looked very handsome in his suit, so he couldn't help but strike up a conversation: "You work for Ou Muchong, how much does he pay you?"

Alex raised an eyebrow: "That's not something I can say."

"Oh." Qiao Jinyi squeezed between the driver and passenger seats, touching the hem of Alex's suit: "The quality is really good, it must be expensive?"

Alex clearly didn't have a perfect formula for dealing with people like him, and could only coax him in a very soft voice: "There's a downhill slope ahead, you need to fasten your seatbelt."

"Okay." Qiao Jinyi sat back down. He really wanted to hear someone talk. The villa on the hillside was secluded and safe, but also very boring.

The further the car drove, the more familiar the buildings became. Qiao Jinyi, almost asleep, leaned closer to the window and asked, somewhat surprised, "Where are we going to look at houses?"

Alex, ever alert, responded quickly even after two hours of silence: "Emerald Bay, a high-end community in a great location, convenient for going anywhere."

Qiao Jinyi remembered that Liang Jinwei owned a flat in Emerald Bay. Last year, Liang Jinwei's father was frequently hospitalized, and Liang Jinwei, burdened with work, had taken him to live in Emerald Bay.

That area was undoubtedly a prime location with shockingly high property prices, but Qiao Jinyi was afraid of running into Liang Jinwei there. He asked, "Do I have any other options? I don't like it there."

"..." The driver glanced back with a hint of resentment, and Alex paused for a moment. He took out his phone: "Let me ask Mr. Ou."

A few minutes later, the car turned around at the roundabout.

The Ou family's ancestors were overseas-trained architects. The Ou family made their fortune in real estate. A house there was an exorbitant price tag for Qiao Jinyi, but for Ou Muchong, the cost was negligible.

In short, Ou Muchong still felt Qiao Jinyi was worth a house.

This was Alex's first time handling something like this for Ou Muchong, and there was no precedent to follow, so he was genuinely unsure how to communicate with Qiao Jinyi.

They went to Qianyu Manor, a project Ou Muchong had been in charge of before graduating from university. To this day, while the five detached houses in the south were not yet fully completed, nearly half of the apartments in the north had been sold.

Following Ou Muchong's instructions, Alex asked, "The second villa on the left belongs to President Ou. He asked you... if you like it."

Qiao Jinyi narrowed his eyes, staring at Alex as if trying to read Ou Muchong's meaning through Alex's eyes, but Alex's expression quickly became impeccable. "Is there a problem?"

"I don't want it." Qiao Jinyi conscientiously forced himself to look away from the villa. "The apartments there are much better, with a great view."

Qiao Jinyi didn't even like the houses in Emerald Bay. Alex thought he would spend the whole day choosing, but he nodded at the first one, very easy to talk to.

Because the deal was finalized so quickly, Qiao Jin didn't want to go back too early. After getting into the car, he asked, "Where are you going later?"

Alex, who was looking at his phone, looked up and asked uncertainly, "Me?"

"Yes."

"I'm going to Lan Er. There's an art exhibition there the day after tomorrow, and it's already closed for setup." Alex put away his phone. "Is there anything else you need? Or should I take you back now?"

Qiao Jin was squeezed between the driver and passenger seats again. One shoulder of his cashmere cardigan slipped down. He asked, "Is it convenient to take me there? I'm just walking around, it won't be a problem, and you don't need to watch over me. You can do your thing."

It wasn't a big deal, and Alex told the driver to take him to Lan Er.

"Lan II" is an art museum that has been a landmark in the area since its construction. Its full name is "Lan II Art Museum," but it's called "Lan II" because Ouyang Xiu already owned a "Lan I Club."

The museum was designed by Ouyang Xiu himself during his university years. The front and back of the building are smooth and clean; the front is made of blue-gray glass, while the back is made of gray-brown tiles. Unless you look very closely, you can hardly see the gaps between the tiles.

The two sides and the roof are designed in a wave-like shape, appearing from above as a huge, thick corrugated cardboard sheet.

Qiao Jinyi remembered seeing an introduction to the building in the school's English newspaper when he was in elementary school. Their English teacher translated the entire article and taught them to read it.

One passage read: "In an era when many designers pursued a sense of luxury, Barron disdained ostentatious appearances, casually creating artistic flowers from inexpensive materials..."

Qiao Jinyi walked into the art museum. At first glance, the simple, mechanical lines and gray walls and floors made it seem like a rough concrete structure. Well-placed, cool-toned lighting was irregularly distributed in every corner and on the ceiling, creating a space with both light and shadow, an atmosphere of mystery and solemnity.

But the clean, transparent glass display cases, gleaming softly, were being carefully moved by staff wearing white gloves. Qiao Jinyi immediately scoffed at the newspaper hype.

He simply didn't believe this effect was achieved with cheap materials. Did making an apple core out of gold make it not gold?

"Who is Barron?" Qiao Jinyi asked Alex.

Alex, who was communicating with his manager about the progress, looked at him in surprise and said, "Barron is President Ou, Ou Muchong."

"..."

Qiao Jinyi found the stairs and went up to the second floor. There were far fewer people on the second floor. The space facing the window was blocked by several floor-to-ceiling square walls, all equally spaced, blocking a large portion of the light.

Qiao Jinyi circled around to the other side and discovered that these square walls were actually display cases, each containing numerous crowns.

"What a narcissistic design..." Qiao Jinyi muttered softly, "Ou Muchong must be very narcissistic."

"What are you doing here?" a voice called out, following her.

Qiao Jinyi looked over and saw that the person was Liang Lijie, the son of Liang Jinwei's stepmother. She glanced at the brochure in her hand, and sure enough, it listed Felix.

The Liang family already knew of Qiao Jinyi's existence. During the Lunar New Year, Liang Jinwei had even brought Qiao Jinyi back to their home. At that time, Mrs. Liang smiled and invited Qiao Jinyi to sit down, but Felix reacted strongly, even throwing a tantrum at Liang Jinwei.

At the time, Qiao Jinyi swallowed his anger. He didn't want to cause trouble for Liang Jinwei, and Mrs. Liang seemed very restrained, not intending to involve him in the adults' feud. Therefore, he ignored Liang Lijie.

But later, he got drunk at a bar and was cornered in a back alley by Mrs. Liang, who had been watching him. Mrs. Liang, still in her car, said to him, "If you don't want to ruin your older brother, and end up with nothing for you and your whining old mother, you'd better tuck your tail between your legs and get lost. Being born into Qiao Lilan's womb is your bad luck. She couldn't beat me twenty years ago, and she won't be any different now."

Qiao Jinyi looked at Liang Lijie, his fists clenched tightly. He suddenly smiled and said to him, "Felix, so you're the one holding the exhibition here. I thought those paintings downstairs were strange; they were ridiculously ugly."
