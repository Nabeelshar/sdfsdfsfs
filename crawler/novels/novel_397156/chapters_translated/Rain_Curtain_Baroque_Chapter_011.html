Chapter 11 You probably won't have it either…

Liang Lijie crossed his arms, hesitated for a moment, and chose to elegantly call out to someone instead of hurling even harsher words or resorting to violence: “Wasn't it already closed? Why are there still some shady characters sneaking in?”

The staff didn't recognize Qiao Jinyi. Qiao Jinyi originally wanted Alex to prove he hadn't sneaked in, but what would Liang Lijie say to Liang Jinwei?

Qiao Jinyi didn't want Liang Jinwei to know what he was doing. Ever since he was scolded in the hospital, he suddenly realized that Liang Jinwei had reached her limit with this burden.

The pain of that slap was no longer vivid, but the shame and anger of being hit remained clear.

He didn't want Liang Jinwei to know where he was or what kind of life he was living now. Besides, he was still a nobody; he was just a parasite in a different place.

The staff member seemed even angrier than Liang Lijie, immediately questioning, "Can't you read? Can't you see the 'No Entry' sign downstairs? You have no manners! Get out of here right now; this isn't a place for you."

Qiao Jinyi was taken aback by the scolding. He snorted coldly and looked at Liang Lijie: "Felix, there's no need to kick him out. Your painting is really awful. Even if you ask me to stay, I'll refuse."

Qiao Jinyi ignored him and followed the instructions of the shouting staff member, intending to leave directly.

Liang Lijie felt amusement at Qiao Jinyi's dejected retreat, and said condescendingly, "Art has a threshold. Someone like you, who can't even get a ticket and only deals with supermarket discount coupons, obviously can't understand."

Qiao Jinyi was led downstairs by a staff member. He wanted to wait for Alex in his car, but the driver had let them out at the front door, so he could only ask, "Could you take me to the parking lot?"

The staff member said with a dark face, "You haven't given me a tip, why should I serve you?"

He then tried to shove him, and Qiao Jinyi could only follow his directions and exit through a small door. Standing by the landscaped area, he grew increasingly angry, but he could only find his own exit and wait for Alex to find him.

After a long while, Alex came running out while still on the phone. Qiao Jinyi stood up from behind the flowerpot: "You finally came to find me!"

Alex said into the phone that he had found her, hung up, and came to greet her. Qiao Jinyi's lips were greasy, and she was holding a paper bag containing an oyster pancake, which she had already eaten unevenly.

"Are you hungry?" Alex asked, a little exasperated. He'd been busy for a while and then remembered his little rascal, whom he'd brought along. He'd searched upstairs and downstairs but couldn't find him. He'd called Ou Muchong to ask for Qiao Jinyi's contact information, only to be told, "I don't have his contact information, so you'd better find him."

Qiao Jinyi took a big bite of his pancake and huffed, "Someone said I snuck in and kicked me out."

"Do you need a tissue?" Alex asked, noticing he was wearing... There were no tissues, so he handed him a handkerchief he'd never used before from his suit pocket: "Is this okay?"

Qiao Jinyi thanked him, wiped his mouth, and said a little embarrassedly, "A lady bought it for me. She saw me sitting there and asked if I needed help. I don't have any money, and I'm very hungry… But I added her contact information, and I'll send her the money when I get back."

Alex was speechless for a moment. He took Qiao Jinyi to the parking lot, got in the car, and sat in the front to call Ou Muchong to report.

When they got home, Qiao Jinyi had already finished a whole oyster pancake. Ou Muchong had just come downstairs for dinner, and Uncle Lin poked his head out to call Qiao Jinyi to wash his hands.

Alex chimed in, "He just ate a piece of oyster omelet."

Ou Muchong didn't seem to care much. Qiao Jinyi readily went to wash her hands and then sat quietly at the table, watching Uncle Lin fiddling with the dessert table.

Ou Muchong only entered the restaurant after Alex left. Uncle Lin and Evan usually wouldn't sit at the table to eat when Ou Muchong was present.

But if Qiao Jinyi was alone, Uncle Lin would eat with him, while Evan preferred to eat separately, using his own plate. As soon as Qiao Jinyi sat down, he would immediately get up and throw the remaining food from his plate into the trash can.

Ou Muchong handed Qiao Jinyi a cup of yogurt and asked, "How was your day?"

"Hmm... I'm very happy to have my own house." Qiao Jinyi's face showed no sign of happiness.

"Did someone make you unhappy?" Ou Muchong put down his chopsticks.

Qiao Jin hesitated for a moment, then nodded. "I really dislike Liang Lijie."

Ou Muchong was a little unsure who he was referring to. "Is Liang Lijie the son the Liang family sent to Thailand?"

"No," Qiao Jin corrected. "Liang Lijie is Felix. The one you're talking about in Thailand is called Liang Lixun. Liang Lixun is the second son, and Felix is the youngest."

Liang Lijie had a fairly good reputation. He was a well-behaved student at the art academy. Compared to his second brother, who was sent to Thailand because of his eccentric personality, Liang Lijie had his own ideas and chose his own path early on.

From his freshman year, he frequently submitted his work to various exhibitions, making him a minor celebrity on campus. Even some art magazines praised him as a rising star artist. Ou Muchong wasn't familiar with this person. They might have exchanged greetings at social events, but hadn't had any deeper contact.

Recently, he rented Lan Er to Liang Lijie for his art exhibition, mainly because Amber was dating his brother.

"What did he do to you?" Ou Muchong waited earnestly for his answer.

Qiao Jin also sprinkled some nuts into her yogurt, poking at it with a spoon, and said angrily, "His paintings are ugly, but he's arrogant."

Ou Muchong didn't really think that was enough to dislike someone. For someone with Ou Muchong's personality, he rarely cared about the personality traits of people unrelated to him, much less whether their achievements were truly deserved.

But he still went along with Qiao Jinyi's emotions and asked, "Is there any other reason?"

"Today I was looking at those crowns on the second floor, and he came up to me and even had the staff chase me away." Qiao Jinyi was still quite angry as she said this.

Ou Muchong frowned slightly: "Didn't you tell him you were a guest I invited?"

"I don't like that kind of bullying." Qiao Jinyi told a small lie, of course, because she was afraid that Liang Jinwei would find out that she really relied on another man for survival; otherwise, he would call Ou Muchong to complain on the spot.

"Good boy." Ou Muchong patted his hair, instructing him, "You didn't eat Liang Lijie's food, there's no need to swallow your anger. How about I take you to the art museum tomorrow?"

This meant he was being backed up, which sounded very appealing, but Qiao Jinyi had reservations. He hesitated for a moment before giving an uncertain answer: "We'll see..."

Qiao Jinyi's phone rang. He stared at the unfamiliar number, clueless, but answered after a moment's hesitation.

Liang Jinwei's voice, suppressing anger, came through the phone: "Qiao Jinyi, are you...?"

Qiao Jinyi hung up without hesitation, expertly opened the call history, and blocked the number. After putting down his phone, he noticed Ou Muchong watching him.

Qiao Jin thought for a moment, then handed over his phone: "I can't reach you. Would it be convenient to add each other's contact information, Mr. Ou?"

Ou Muchong snorted coldly, knowing he was just fooling him, but still took the phone and added his number and social media contacts.

Qiao Jin really couldn't eat. He forced down two spoonfuls of yogurt and started creating something in it. Besides nuts, he broke off a piece of shortbread and mixed it in. He didn't dare eat it himself, so he scooped a spoonful and fed it to Ou Muchong's lips.

He didn't understand that this was an extremely ambiguous gesture, carrying a testing connotation. Since it was a test, there was bound to be an answer. Ou Muchong stared at him, leaned forward slightly, and unabashedly opened his mouth and ate it.

Qiao Jinyi innocently asked, "How does it taste?"

Ou Muchong choked for a moment, then said mercilessly, "You probably don't have any talent for cooking."

Ou Muchong couldn't eat dinner, but his other appetite had been whetted. He got up, touched the back of Qiao Jinyi's neck, and whispered, "Come upstairs. Tell me which staff member helped Liang Lijie get rid of you."

This was naturally an excuse. As soon as Qiao Jinyi was led to Ou Muchong's room, she couldn't help but tremble, looking as pitiful as could be, a stark contrast to when she had eagerly kissed Ou Muchong on the lips.

Ou Muchong was slightly surprised by his innocent expression. To comfort him, he pulled him onto his lap, but Qiao Jinyi misunderstood his intentions, his eyes welling up with tears, and he let out a fearful whimper.

"Don't be afraid," Ou Muchong said, letting him sit sideways on his lap, his arms encircling his waist, gently patting his back. He coaxed him, "Obviously you're not as open as you think, so let's get to know each other a little better first. I won't do anything too inappropriate, and please don't tremble, okay?"

Qiao Jinyi didn't want to tremble, but he couldn't control it. To prevent Ou Muchong from seeing him as a conman who only wanted the jewels but wouldn't let anyone touch them, he had to express his sincerity through actions, wrapping his arms around Ou Muchong's neck and burying his face in his shoulder.

"Good girl." Ou Muchong suppressed his disappointment at not getting the food and smiled gentlemanly. "We can do something else. Do you know how to play chess?"

"Yes," Qiao Jinyi answered calmly and confidently.

Ou Muchong took out black and white stones, assuming they were going to play Go, and even deliberately letting her win. But despite the obvious opening, Qiao Jinyi stubbornly continued placing stones near her connected pieces…

Ou Muchong was silent for a moment. "Gomoku?"

"I already have three here," Qiao Jinyi blinked her thick, curly eyelashes, reminding him with magnanimity.

A gentle smile appeared on Ou Muchong's face as he relentlessly pursued and blocked Qiao Jinyi's moves. The chessboard was mostly filled, yet Qiao Jinyi still hadn't found a chance to win. He noticed Ou Muchong had an opportunity, but whether he was too focused on blocking him to see it, or simply didn't want him to win, it was unclear.

Qiao Jinyi felt a sweat on his back. He hesitated for a long time, holding the chess piece, then suddenly leaned over the edge of the board and planted a kiss on Ou Muchong's lips.

Ou Muchong caught him by the waist to prevent him from falling. When he sat back down, Ou Muchong was somewhat distracted. When he came to his senses, Qiao Jinyi's black pieces were already connected in a row.

Qiao Jinyi smiled broadly at him, a beautiful and adorable smile.

He rarely feigned emotions; when unhappy, he was visibly listless, and when happy, his entire being radiated joy.

Ou Muchong picked up the adorable Qiao Jinyi and placed her on the sofa. Qiao Jinyi immediately tensed, her lips pressed into a thin line, her eyes fixed intently on Ou Muchong.

"You're so soft to hold," Ou Muchong's voice was slightly hoarse. "Sleep with me tonight."

"Just sleeping?" Qiao Jinyi asked him.

Ou Muchong hesitated for a moment, then nodded in agreement, "Okay."

I almost accidentally saved chapter twelve as chapter eleven just now! Oops, I'm not bragging about having a lot of drafts, but having a lot of drafts does have the problem of accidentally saving the wrong chapter. [shy]
