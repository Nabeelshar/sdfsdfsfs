Chapter Two

The next morning, Wang Qiongqiong, sporting a neat short haircut, came in, munching on a steamed bun. As soon as she sat down, she asked,

“Tell me, what happened last night? How did you end up bumping into those two behind you?” She took another bite of her bun.

“Last night, Uncle said he'd come pick you up, which scared me. I quickly and firmly said I'd bring you back, and that's when he agreed. What did you two do last night?” Wang Qiongqiong rattled off her story. Han Yuzhi patiently waited for her to finish, then took out a bottle of milk and handed it to her.

Liu Pei, standing behind her, said, “It's a long story.”

Han Yuzhi then took out two more bottles of milk and some fruit, placing them on their table. She looked at Yu Zibai and Liu Pei, then gestured to Wang Qiongqiong, who was opening a bottle, “Understand?”

Liu Pei: Oh, so you can't say, right?

Han Yuzhi blinked: Good, I understand.

Liu Pei looked at the milk: So this is bribery?

Han Yuzhi: Yes, it's a thank you.

Liu Pei: I understand, shut up.

But Liu Pei didn't understand. Was there any need to hide it from her?

Of course there was. Qiongqiong has no secrets from my mom. It's too easy for my mom to get things from her. If my mom finds out, my dad finds out too, and that won't be fun.

Han Yuzhi's bright eyes looked sincere. "Nothing much, I was just reading in the bookstore for a while and lost track of time. I happened to run into them on the same way, so I borrowed their phones."

Liu Pei: Master. The highest art of lying. Everything you said was true, but you didn't tell the whole story.

He was about to take all the food Han Yuzhi had given him when Yu Zibo had already taken it.

Liu Pei: Zibo, didn't you say you never eat food given to you by girls?

Yu Zibo: Is this food? What does this mean?

Liu Pei: Hush money?

Yu Zibo: Good to know.

Liu Pei's forehead creased: What's wrong with me? Can't I not eat it?

Wang Qiongqiong nodded, realizing this was something A-Zhi would do. She then asked, "You live in the same neighborhood as them? They live there too?"

Liu Pei: "Please, boss, we've been sitting at desks in front of and behind each other for at least a year, and you don't even know where we live?"

Wang Qiongqiong rolled her eyes, "Why would I need to know where you live? You're not a banknote, why would I bother caring about your place?"

So annoying!

Wang Qiongqiong turned her head and saw several girls running past the window, looking in their direction. She sighed and shook her head.

"These junior girls nowadays are so idle. What's so interesting about them?"

Liu Pei retorted, "Look at you! Our Bai Zi's undisputed school heartthrob doesn't even have this much attention?"

Yu Zibai glanced at him, too lazy to respond.

Han Yuzhi looked outside curiously.

Liu Pei chuckled, "It's okay, it'll be fine in a few days. We went through this in our first year of high school, and it's much better now. It's just the first-year girls who're curious. Back then..."

Wang Qiongqiong, annoyed, said, "Shut up! Do you think you're the only one with a mouth?"

The morning study bell rang, and Liu Pei obeyed.

In the first physics class, the physics teacher arrived early. Liu Pei leisurely handed the test paper back to Wang Qiongqiong, then said slowly,

"The last question seems to have a problem."

Wang Qiongqiong immediately turned around and glared at him angrily, "Why didn't you say so earlier?"

Liu Pei retorted innocently, "You told me to shut up!"

Wang Qiongqiong didn't have time to confront him, "Azhi, quickly help me check where I went wrong!"

The physics teacher was kind, but his methods were quite the opposite. In his words, no matter how difficult the physics questions were, if you made a mistake, just copy it a few more times, and you'll remember it.

Wang Qiongqiong wasn't afraid of the physics teacher, but she was afraid of being caught making a mistake by him.

At noon, fearing being held accountable, Liu Pei offered to treat Han Yuzhi and Wang Qiongqiong to lunch. "Let's go to the small canteen for stir-fries."

"No problem."

"Xingji, let's go, let's rip off a ton!" He then casually called to Chen Xingji next door.

Liu Pei secretly glanced at Chen Xingji. What business is it of yours? Be smart.

Chen Xingji gave a shy smile, looked at Liu Pei, and nodded embarrassedly, "Okay."

Liu Pei was annoyed. If you're embarrassed, don't agree! How can you be so opportunistic? You're everywhere!

Liu Pei watched Wang Qiongqiong, who was unceremoniously ordering food, skip over Chen Xingji.

"Han Yuzhi, aren't you going to order a few dishes?" You seem like you'd be more polite.

Han Yuzhi said, "No need, I'm not picky. Qiongqiong knows what I like."

Liu Pei then looked at Yu Zibai, "Bai Zi, why don't you go take a look?"

Yu Zibai looked at him, "Are you sure?"

Liu Pei thought for a moment, then decided against it. That woman, Wang Qiongqiong, wasn't exactly polite to Bai Zi, let alone him. Maybe seeing him get ruthless would backfire.

Even with his preparations, looking at the several large meat dishes on the table, Liu Pei's heart bled. She was truly inhuman!

"Swiping someone else's card, eating my own food, awesome! Let's eat!" Wang Qiongqiong pretended not to see Liu Pei's distorted face and unceremoniously ate a full bowl of rice.

Liu Pei gritted his teeth. What a glutton! He forced a smile at Wang Qiongqiong; he couldn't let this money go to waste.

Han Yuzhi and Yu Zibo remained silent. A free meal was fine; a smile was enough. No need to add fuel to the fire.

A few days later, when Liu Pei and Yu Zibo saw Han Yuzhi wandering the old town alleys again, they looked at each other speechlessly.

Yu Zibo raised an eyebrow. "Didn't bring your phone again?"

Han Yuzhi sighed helplessly. "I did, and I set the time, but... it was out of battery."

Liu Pei was puzzled. "Didn't I tell you the route?"

Han Yuzhi was equally puzzled. "...I followed your instructions exactly."

Liu Pei touched his phone. "I don't think any of the routes I explained lead back."

Han Yuzhi glanced at him, then repeated his words verbatim.

Liu Pei: I give up. Good memory, but what's the problem?

Yu Zibai's eyes gleamed with a smile. "You don't know your way around, do you?"

Liu Pei was startled. "Huh? You have no sense of direction?"

Han Yuzhi calmly shook her head. "No, I know my way around."

Liu Pei, "Which direction are you facing right now?"

Han Yuzhi looked at him and thought for a moment. "North?"

Liu Pei, okay, we came in through the north gate. Never mind.

Yu Zibai strolled forward slowly, glancing at the blush on her fair face, which contrasted sharply with her aloof exterior, making her appear particularly lively. "How long have you been wandering around?"

Han Yuzhi silently followed. "...Just a little while."

Liu Pei chuckled. "Next time, you should call us. It'll probably be faster for us to come and get you."

Han Yuzhi thought about it and nodded.

"......"

When Han Yuzhi arrived home, her father, Han Junwen, was already there.

"Dad, I'm home! Where's Mom?"

"Upstairs, Zhizhi. Next time, call and Dad will pick you up."

"No need, Dad. I'll come earlier next time. Today was an exception."

"You said it was special last time too. You always have an excuse."

"The bus goes directly there. There's nothing to worry about."

"Then why did you take the direct bus so late today?"

"You used to be with Qiongqiong, but now you don't know the area well," and given your excellent sense of direction, he was even more worried. Han Junwen wouldn't budge, continuing his earnest persuasion, "Dad can wait for you."

Han Yuzhi had no choice but to say, "I have classmates in the neighborhood, and if it gets too late, I'll go with them."

Han Junwen frowned. "Really?"

"Yes," Han Yuzhi replied firmly.

Upstairs, Shi Yanfei, seeing that her husband's attempts to persuade her had failed, leisurely came downstairs.

"Aunt An from the kitchen saved some sweet soup for you, go have some."

Han Junwen looked at his wife, while Shi Yanfei lazily returned his gaze. *I told you before, your daughter has a strong will; I'm not wasting my time arguing with her.*

Han Junwen shook his head helplessly.

"Are you adjusting well to the new class?"

Han Yuzhi nodded. "Yeah, not bad."

"This class is great in every way, except the pressure is high."

Shi Yanfei said, "Do you think transferring to this school midway is so easy? This is the only class that only considers grades. Getting in will reduce the trouble."

"Luckily, Qiongqiong is here. Daughter, don't put too much pressure on yourself. Just make sure your grades are decent."

"Hmm...Mom, this soup isn't very sweet."

"I told Aunt An to put less in. Why do you have such a sweet tooth?"

"By the way, Teacher Qin called today to ask if you want to participate in a large dance competition. There's a certificate, which can boost your college entrance exam score."

She shook her head. "No." She wasn't planning to study art, so there was no need.

"Okay." Wang Qiongqiong and Han Yuzhi entered the Youwei Bookstore together. The wind chimes under the eaves tinkled crisply in the breeze, creating a serene and tranquil atmosphere.

"No wonder you like coming here; the environment is so comfortable."

The bookstore was filled with the faint scent of paper and ink. Soft lighting bathed the bookshelves, as if draping each book in a warm cloak. Rows of neat bookshelves lined the wooden floor, and several comfortable sofas sat near the window, each with a different vintage table lamp. It was very quiet, broken only by the occasional sound of pages turning.

Wang Qiongqiong's voice lowered as she gestured towards the nearby anime section, "I'm going to find some anime I like to watch."

Han Yuzhi expertly walked towards the book she had been reading earlier. Having read another book by this author, she couldn't help but want to understand the emotions and thoughts he wanted to express through more of his writing.

Her grandfather had said that the marks a writer's pen leaves on paper are like digging into the depths of their heart; they are recorders of the times and disseminators of ideas. Understanding them through their works is a good way. This author's physical condition is similar to Wang Yi's; both are unable to stand. Without experiencing their suffering, one cannot truly empathize. It's worth trying to understand.

She had previously recommended a book that she hoped would be helpful.

Yu Zibo and Liu Pei were waiting for the bus at the bus stop when Liu Pei suddenly pointed and said, "Hey, aren't those two our classmates from the front row?"

Yu Zibo looked over and saw Han Yuzhi and Wang Qiongqiong at the bookstore window a hundred meters away.

"Let's go check it out."

Han Yuzhi and Wang Qiongqiong were engrossed in their books when the lights suddenly dimmed. Looking up, they saw two large figures blocking the light from above.

"What are you two doing here?"

"Come see what's so magical about this; you two are so engrossed in it."

"The allure of books is boundless; how could someone as vulgar as you understand?"

"Hey, then tell me," Liu Pei said disdainfully, pointing to the comic book on the table, "What kind of allure do you see in it?"

"The allure of the story."

He pointed to the book Han Yuzhi was reading, "At least she's reading something that looks quite sophisticated; you're just so childish."

"Mind your own business!"

"Have you finished your homework?"

"Oops!" Wang Qiongqiong slapped her forehead. She had only intended to look at it briefly before buying it and taking it home, but she'd missed her turn. "See, that's its charm, it makes you forget about time!"

"..."

Han Yuzhi checked the time on her phone; it was almost time for her. "Let's go, do you want this book?"

"Never mind, I'm almost finished reading it, I'll come back next time," Wang Qiongqiong flipped through the book and shook her head.

The two put the books back in their places, went to pay, and took out their membership cards. "Excuse me, both of you."

After paying, the four returned to the bus stop, and Han Yuzhi and the others caught the last bus.

Liu Pei sighed, "This is my first time being a knight in shining armor."

Han Yuzhi said, "This is also my first time being escorted like this."

Liu Pei said, "...Our Bai Zi is usually the one being escorted."

Han Yuzhi said, "You can think of it as me escorting you."

"......"

Well, it seems there's no hope for the beauty's meal.

A faint smile flickered across Yu Zibai's handsome face as the lights outside the car window flashed by.
