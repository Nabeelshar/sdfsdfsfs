Chapter Three

Yu Zibo looked speechlessly at Liu Pei, who was slumped over his desk early in the morning. "Were you playing games again last night?"

Liu Pei replied listlessly, "No, I had a long talk with my 'dear homework' all night long."

Yu Zibo, "...Why didn't you think of that sooner?"

"I think school teachers need to deeply understand the specific meaning of the 'Mid-Autumn Festival'."

Zhang Qingyun, who happened to be passing by, overheard this and quickly chimed in,

"That's so true! This is a time for family reunions, how can it be taken up by mere homework? It's really too much!"

"Right? Look at everyone, even the girl in front of me looks so listless. This definitely isn't just an individual problem."

Wang Qiongqiong turned her head slightly and glared at someone.

Liu Pei, "You misheard, I wasn't talking about you."

Wang Qiongqiong didn't have the energy to argue with him.

"As a student in a top class of a top school, shouldn't you receive a little preferential treatment?"

Han Yuzhi smiled at her, "In the teacher's eyes, extra homework is just special treatment. Grading homework is hard work too."

Wang Qiongqiong, "Ah Zhi, where are you from?"

Han Yuzhi, "From the farthest reaches of the world."

Yu Qian, who sat in front of her, flicked her long ponytail, turned around to express her disagreement, and was also annoyed by the feeling that the three-day holiday felt like twice the amount of homework.

"Hey," "Do people like us in the class need homework to keep us motivated? It's unnecessary. Why make things so difficult for us?"

Liu Pei, "Yeah, homework is a complete waste of time!"

Liang Ya scoffed, "If everyone were this self-disciplined, why would homework always be done at the last minute?"

As the discussion progressed, many people gathered around to try and stay awake. Liu Wei, one of the more active members of the class, said earnestly,

"It's not that we don't want to, it's that we have no choice."

Liang Ya glanced at him sideways, her eyes blatantly telling him, "Let's see how you make up that story."

“Your Majesty, do you know about procrastination? It's something we can't control, isn't it?”

“Heh, did you take your medication?”

Liu Wei wasn't embarrassed at all. “The symptoms are mild, not that serious.”

“But if the teachers continue to ‘make things difficult’ for us, it's hard to say.”

“Is that so? Come to the office after class, let's have a good talk.”

The sudden female voice interrupted, instantly switching everyone from silence to good student mode. They all returned to their seats in a flash, eyes fixed straight ahead.

With the sound of footsteps, the homeroom teacher strolled in through the back door.

The students exchanged furtive glances.

"When did you get here?"

"I was careless, I was careless! Why wasn't anyone keeping watch?"

"Wow, our teacher is getting more and more amazing! She can even walk so lightly and silently in high heels!"

"...Oh no, our teacher's going to pull something."

Zheng Tongying stood on the podium with a smile, surveying the circle of heads below.

"Who has procrastination disorder? I know that symptom well."

"...Huh?"

"Who?" "I wasn't a student myself, so firstly, 'fight fire with fire,' you know? That's a well-founded theory in Traditional Chinese Medicine. We can help with shifting the importance of homework."

"Secondly, eliminate distractions and create a distraction-free environment, like turning off your phone and staying away from social media."

"..."Teacher, this is stripping away our joys in life! This is our magic weapon against endless homework!"

Zheng Tongying's face turned serious. "Why don't you trust your teacher? Are you really not afraid to investigate? Come on, tell me, who needs help?"

A circle of heads shook their heads repeatedly.

"Teacher, we were just joking."

"That's not good. We can't hide our problems. Teachers will do their best to help those who need it."

"..." That might kill us.

"Teacher, we were just talking about my big yellow dog. We said he's so human-like. Every time we call him home for dinner, he drags his feet, like a procrastinator."

"...Pfft." Someone couldn't help but burst out laughing.

"Really? Well, your dog is quite intelligent, but he only learns bad habits. You should take this as a warning."

"Teacher, don't worry."

"...Hahaha, hahaha," finally, someone couldn't help but laugh out loud. Then, quickly covering his mouth, Liu Wei secretly bared his teeth at them. These heartless beasts! Whose reputation did I sacrifice for? They're not even as good as my dog, Da Huang.

Someone couldn't help but laugh and quickly covered their mouths. Liu Wei secretly bared his teeth at them. These heartless beasts! Whose reputation did I sacrifice for? They're not even as good as my dog, Da Huang.

Zheng Tongying smiled, "Alright, since it's not necessary, let's start class. Class representative, collect the homework first."

"..."

Wang Qiongqiong chewed on the ribs in her mouth. The ribs in the cafeteria were still the best. Compared to those at home, they were practically gourmet food. It's just that they weren't available every day.

"A-Zhi, do you want to go out and play during the National Day holiday?"

"I should go to my grandparents' house."

“Then you don’t need to stay for the full seven days, just leave two days to play.”

Han Yuzhi thought for a moment and nodded, her hands busy picking out green peppers.

Liu Pei and Yu Zibo, carrying their trays, saw the three of them and sat down.

Liu Pei: "Seriously? You don't eat green peppers in this stir-fried eggs with green peppers?"

Wang Qiongqiong picked up a piece with her chopsticks. "It's too raw. The cafeteria food is always so random. You can have my greens; they're more cooked today."

"It's okay, I have enough."

Liu Pei: "Where are you going for National Day?"

Wang Qiongqiong: "Get out of here, what's it to you?"

Liu Pei: "You don't understand, it's more fun when there are lots of people."

"That depends on who you're with," he said, glancing at her. "As for you, forget it."

With you around, I instantly lose all interest in traveling.

Liu Pei: "We'll cover all the snacks."

Wang Qiongqiong: "Deal! Bring lots of potato chips, I want the LS brand."

Yu Zibo looked at Liu Pei, who immediately said,

"No problem, I'll take care of it all."

"So where are we going?"

"By the way, A-Zhi, where are we going?"

They haven't even decided yet.

“Let’s check, there are only a few famous tourist attractions in our city.”

“Hey, right, how about Jinshan Scenic Area? It’s been a long time since I’ve been there, I heard it’s changed a lot.”

“Have you guys been there?”

Chen Xingji, “No, it’s a bit far.”

Liu Pei, “Who goes there alone for no reason?”

Wang Qiongqiong pointed at Yu Zibai, “Hey, don’t say that, I know you’re from out of town, you probably haven’t been with Liu Pei either.”

“Well, Azhi and I used to frequent it when we were kids, we probably wouldn’t even recognize it now, it’s good value for money.”

“Then it’s decided!”

The others had no objections, they didn’t care.

"Which day are you going to play?"

"The last day, I guess. Azhi has to spend a few days with his grandparents."

"Oh, Baizi also has to go back to City B to be with his grandparents," she said, looking at Yu Zibai, "You should come back early."

Wang Qiongqiong, "Playing is fun, but just thinking about that homework instantly kills half my enthusiasm."

Han Yuzhi, "Finish it as soon as possible."

Wang Qiongqiong immediately complained, "Azhi, what will I do if you leave? No, you have to come back early to supervise my homework!" Han Yuzhi, “…”

Liu Pei, “Hey, that’s great, let’s do it together!”

“Why are you involved in everything? I didn’t realize you were this capable back in freshman year!”

“Look at what you’re saying, we weren’t familiar with each other back then.”

“We’re still not familiar now.”

“It won’t affect doing homework together, we’re more efficient together.”

“Yes, it will improve your study efficiency.”

“Hehe, same thing.”

“Tch,” Wang Qiongqiong said disdainfully.

“Thinking about how hard the ancients studied, I have to admire them. Things like ‘hanging oneself from the rafters’ and ‘using fireflies to illuminate one’s studies,’ tsk tsk, I’d probably be a complete wastrel in ancient times.”

“Hey, I suddenly realize you do have some good points,” Wang Qiongqiong remarked.

Liu Pei immediately perked up, "Really? What?"

"Self-awareness."

"......" I shouldn't have had any expectations of you. What kind of nice things could come out of your mouth?"

Yu Zibo said, “There’s no comparison. The social systems are different. In ancient times, the education system was a crucial system for selecting officials, closely linking knowledge with power. The significance of social status was completely different; it emphasized ‘excellence in learning leads to officialdom,’ making it inseparable from one’s career.”

Liu Pei was moved, “You really understand my character, Zibo.”

Han Yuzhi said, “It created the social concept of ‘all other professions are inferior, only studying is superior.’ If you didn’t grow up in that era, you wouldn’t understand the core of the education system at that time. Being ‘the head of the four classes’ shows that the meaning of studying back then was completely different from now.”

“Then it’s better now. At least there are science subjects to choose from. Back then, it was all about memorizing the Four Books and Five Classics and writing eight-legged essays.” Wang Qiongqiong shook her head wildly at the thought, “You’re going crazy.” Liu Pei: "Then I'll just stay a playboy. The competition for the college entrance exam is so fierce these days. Before, there were also the county exam, the palace exam, and so on. It was like passing five checkpoints and defeating six generals! You wouldn't dare participate without a lot of mental fortitude."

Chen Xingji: "The prefectural exam, the provincial exam, the metropolitan exam, the palace exam..."

Wang Qiongqiong: "Hmm, compared to before, studying doesn't seem so tiring now."

Liu Pei agrees: "Yeah, I'll study hard. It's settled then, our mutual aid group is officially established!"

"......", Who agreed to that?!

It's all talk and no action.
