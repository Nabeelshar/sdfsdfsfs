Chapter One: Like First Encounters

N City

The night sky was as dark as ink, dotted with countless stars and scattered moonlight, as if the earth were draped in a thin black veil, tranquil and mysterious.

As a protected historical area of the city, the old town's ancient alleyways, like hidden veins in the long river of time, quietly meandered beyond the city's bustling activity. The crescent moon, appearing and disappearing like a shy maiden, made the already dimly lit alleyways even more gloomy, and the sound of footsteps on the time-worn stone slabs seemed exceptionally soft.

"I've walked this alley so many times. But after everyone moved away, it suddenly feels so mysterious. It's perfect for something to happen," a boy's voice rang out, especially clear in the quiet night.

No response came, but the boy didn't seem to mind. He shook his aching arm and hissed involuntarily.

"That madman's a bull, so unsportsmanlike! Playing ball like it's a war," the pale moonlight illuminated two slender figures.

The boy speaking wore a white T-shirt, his other hand casually carrying his backpack. His face was sharply defined, his features regular, and a carefree and bright smile played on his lips. He exuded a sunny and somewhat reckless aura.

Seeing his companion glance at him indifferently, the boy in white guiltily touched his nose, then said with a hint of righteous indignation,

"We didn't see each other for the whole summer vacation, just wanted to catch up, who knew he'd misunderstand?"

"No, he also proved he 'missed you' a lot."

The boy in white, "..."

At this moment, the moon peeked out, illuminating the face of the boy in blue. His features were exquisitely handsome, his eyes sparkling like stars, his black hair fluttering in the wind, all highlighting his youthful vigor and clean, refreshing air. His schoolbag casually slung over his shoulder, exuding a free and untamed spirit, making one sigh at the beauty of youth.

The boy in white couldn't remain silent for long. Just as he was about to say something more, he suddenly heard an untimely voice. He slowed his pace, exchanged a glance with the boy in blue, and both stopped. After listening carefully to make sure they hadn't misheard, they simultaneously quickened their pace, albeit quietly.

The boy in white looked serious, inwardly cursing, wondering if he had made a bad blunder.

The old town alleys here are generally narrow, with high walls on both sides. Although old, the environment is relatively peaceful. Perhaps due to urban redevelopment as part of its character, the security is decent. He had only spoken carelessly without thinking; could he have really run into bad luck?!

As the two approached the source of the sound, it became clearer. A slightly gruff male voice, tinged with anxiety, said,

"...Stop...stop..."

"Don't panic," came a gentle female voice, calm and unhurried.

"......"

This wasn't what they expected.

The two put down their backpacks near the corner. The boy in blue casually pulled a hardcover book from his backpack, and the boy in white followed suit. Then, realizing he didn't have a suitable weapon, he weighed his light backpack and simply took off one of his shoes, earning a speechless look from his companion.

"Hurry up and hand it over!" With that unsteady, gruff voice, the two no longer hesitated. Just as they were about to rush out to coordinate their attack, they suddenly heard a "bang," followed by a cry of "Ah!"

Without a second thought, they instinctively ran out, then froze on the spot.

A middle-aged man stood with his back to them, his hands bound behind his back by a girl. He was kneeling on one knee, his back pressed against the girl's knee, screaming "Ahhh!" and trembling uncontrollably. It was hard to tell whether it was from pain or fear; he looked rather pitiful.

The girl turned around at the sound, revealing fair and beautiful features, her bright eyes looking at them.

"Oh, it's you... Yu Zibai, Liu Pei," the girl's voice was pure and gentle, brushing past their ears, incongruous with her current posture.

The boy in white, Liu Pei, stood there, mouth agape, leaning forward, frozen for a long moment before reacting instinctively.

"Ha...ha, yes, it's us, hello," he stammered, then added, "Han Yuzhi, classmate."

Following the other's gaze, he silently put down the shoes he was holding, watching Yu Zibai walk away expressionlessly. His sense of smell seemed to return, and he quickly put on his shoes, his breath coming in ragged gasps.

He couldn't help but say, "How about...we leave first?" "Do as you please!"

Yu Zibai picked up on his words, "Do you need any help?"

Liu Pei blinked, gesturing to Yu Zibai: "Bai Zi, does she look like she needs help? Don't try to silence her."

Appearances can be deceiving! Han Yuzhi is a beautiful woman, and a seemingly quiet and refined lady at that. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I'd probably doubt it was a lie. Someone who can be best friends with Wang Qiongqiong is definitely no ordinary person.

Although this thug doesn't look very tall or large, anyone who dares to fight back is a true hero. Someone like that needs help? Are you kidding me?

To someone who doesn't know the situation, it's clearly the one who wanted to commit the crime who needs help more!

Han Yuzhi looked at Yu Zibai and nodded. "Please call the police for me."

The alleyway, shrouded in the dim yellow light of distant streetlights, appeared dark and tranquil, as if harboring a great secret. The walls on both sides of the alley were covered with mottled marks, the bricks and stones exuding the weight of time, seemingly telling an ancient history, or quietly recording the stories that had unfolded.

The three sat on the ground on their backpacks, while the sensible thug quietly shrank in the middle, trying to minimize his presence, appearing weak, pitiful, and helpless.

Liu Pei glanced at Han Yuzhi, then at the ridiculous thug.

"How did you get here alone so late?"

Han Yuzhi hesitated for a moment. "...I got lost."

"......"

The alleyways here are quite complex, winding and labyrinthine, making it difficult for someone unfamiliar with the area to navigate for the first time.

The problem is, few people usually walk here, especially at night. Even with wide eyesight, it's hard to see the way. Anyone brave enough to walk here alone is definitely not reckless.

"Do you live nearby?"

"Dongfang Jincheng."

What a coincidence! It's only been a short time since school started that I haven't run into this transfer student.

“How about I tell you the route, just in case?”

Han Yuzhi thought about it and agreed, nodding happily.

She hadn't lived here long and wasn't familiar with the area. Today, she'd found a bookstore across from the school and, out of curiosity, had lingered reading. She'd lost track of time and missed the last direct bus, so this was the only way to transfer.

So, Liu Pei enthusiastically began explaining the correct route, “Enter the city from the north gate, then walk straight for 100 meters… turn right and walk 50 meters… turn right onto the 70-degree road, not the 130-degree one…”

“Wrong, that road is definitely more than 50 meters.”

“…”

The three looked at the person who had suddenly cut in, who then lowered their head, trembling.

Liu Pei glared at the person who had shrank back. "Your arm doesn't hurt anymore, huh? Daring to doubt me? And now I finally know where he got the courage? It's definitely alcohol emboldening him."

"...Anyway, it shouldn't be more than a hundred meters."

Yu Zibai watched the two of them; one spoke sincerely, the other listened attentively...

As for the effect, a few days later, when the two saw the same person wandering around in the alleyway looking for directions again, it was clear.

The three of them didn't wait long before the police arrived. The police car was parked outside, and three officers got in: a young man, a middle-aged officer, and a policewoman. The three of them were speechless for a moment upon seeing the scene, yet also found it amusing.

Three children sat around, relaxed, while the assailant, his hands tied behind his back, sat quietly in the middle. For a moment, the scene appeared quite harmonious.

After watching the police handcuff the man, Liu Pei quickly grabbed his shoelaces, hastily tied them together, and finally managed to put his shoes on.

Because they needed to go back to give statements, the three of them got into a police car together.

Listening to the sound of the police car, Liu Pei remarked, "So this is what it feels like to ride in a police car."

The young man in the passenger seat couldn't help but laugh and ask, "What does it feel like?"

Liu Pei, "Hehe, a little excited."

The young policeman couldn't resist teasing him, "That's because you haven't done it enough. You'll get used to it."

Liu Pei, "...Huh?...Huh!" Dude, what do you mean?

The others couldn't help but laugh.

"Look how scared you are! Judging by your looks, you haven't even taken the college entrance exam yet, have you? Think about going to a proper university!"

"No, no, thank you."

"You can be our colleagues when you come back. See, we already have a history."

"No, I refuse."

"Being a policeman, sitting in the front, feels completely different."

Liu Pei, "Hehe, no need."

The policeman in the driver's seat chuckled, "Xiao Wu, you've already gotten yourself into this mess, don't drag them down with you."

Xiao Wu disagreed, "Uncle Lei, how can you expose your weaknesses like that? Judging from what happened today, do you have some talent?"

Uncle Lei, "In our line of work, first you need to have a clear understanding of what we do, and you also need to be interested and ambitious. Otherwise, don't get involved lightly."

Upon hearing this, Xiao Wu fell silent, seemingly lost in thought.

Indeed, the police profession, aside from its high-risk environment and frequent handling of emergencies, sometimes facing violent clashes, along with its irregular working hours and the need for on-call duties, is enough to deter many.

Uncle Lei then said to the three young men, "You three are lucky today; you didn't encounter anything truly vicious."

Although truly vicious individuals generally wouldn't appear in places so close to the police station, a warning still needs to be given.

It only took a few minutes to get to the police station. Considering the three were minors, they wanted to call their parents, but the three of them resolutely refused, saying they could handle it themselves and wanted to go home as soon as possible because they had school the next day.

Just kidding, when parents arrive, even a small matter can become a big deal.

There was no other way but to arrange for them to give statements and finish quickly.

The three of them each recounted what happened, and there wasn't much to question.

Yu Zibai and his companion arrived quite late and only then learned the whole story.

It was just bad luck for Han Yuzhi; she got lost and wandered around this alley, which is probably why she was targeted. In the end, it was a tragedy for the weaker one.

After the statement was taken, the young policeman couldn't help but mutter,

"Not bad, I can't even catch a hero rescuing a damsel in distress..."

After receiving a ten-minute lecture from the police officer at the station, the three immediately retreated and took a taxi back to their neighborhood.
