Chapter Five

When the group arrived at the entrance of the Daijinshan Scenic Area, they saw a huge archway, its traditional architectural style exuding classical charm. The area around the entrance was lush with vegetation, the trees providing ample shade and creating a vibrant atmosphere, offering a sense of tranquility away from the hustle and bustle.

"My tireless writing yesterday was worth it; the scenery looks quite nice," Liu Pei exclaimed, observing the bustling crowd.

The others ignored his mutterings, buying tickets and picking up maps to explore the area.

"Wow, the food street inside is quite long!" Wang Qiongqiong remarked curiously, looking at the food signs.


"What a waste of all the effort we put in carrying so much!" Liu Pei and Yu Zibo each carried a backpack full of food.

"Don't worry, snacks won't fill you up, I guarantee they'll be gone," Wang Qiongqiong said hastily, worried he might have left the snacks at a store.

Liu Pei gave her a disapproving look, but Wang Qiongqiong didn't seem to care.

Yu Zibo said, "If you're not hungry, let's go shopping first."

The group agreed, and they hadn't even finished their breakfast.

"Where to go first?"

Han Yuzhi glanced at the nearest attraction on the map. "How about the Maple Leaf Garden?"

Although it was called the Maple Leaf Garden, almost the entire hillside was covered in maple leaves. At this time of year, it was as if the forest had donned its autumn attire; the maple leaves were fiery red, the ginkgo leaves golden, and the entire forest was ablaze with color—a breathtaking sight. Strolling through it felt like stepping into a vibrant, colorful world; every step was a painting.

"It's so beautiful," Wang Qiongqiong exclaimed, plucking a maple leaf.

"No wonder there are still so many people on the last day of the holiday."

"I heard the cherry blossom grove here is also beautiful. It's a pity; April or May would be perfect," Han Yuzhi said, standing on a high point, her eyes filled with a sea of fiery red.

No wonder Liu Yuxi wrote in his poem, "I say autumn surpasses spring," autumn can indeed be breathtakingly beautiful.

"I definitely have to come again next year. It's such a disservice to myself as a local not to know the local sights!"

"Come on, let's make the most of our time!"

"Wait, let's take some photos!"

The group strolled along the ecological area, wandered through the pink muhly grass fields, and finally hiked together.

"Are you sure you can handle this?" Wang Qiongqiong looked around at the seemingly unfamiliar scenery.

Liu Pei stared at the scenic area map in his hand, comparing it repeatedly.

"Miss, don't you even look at the information you gave me? Every road here is winding and rugged. The landmarks you provided aren't clear at all!"

Wang Qiongqiong knew she was in the wrong. "It's not that you're bragging about your sense of direction."

Liu Pei: "Look at those three mountains ahead. They're almost exactly as you described. Why don't you try to recall any other features?"

Wang Qiongqiong: "That was so long ago, back in elementary school. It's good enough that I can remember these two features."

Liu Pei: "We're already quite far in the area, and there aren't many people here..." "You guys were really good at having fun when you were little!"

Wang Qiongqiong: "Back then, this place wasn't developed yet, and it was pretty much the same everywhere. Now it's completely different, and we haven't been here in ages."

Liu Pei: "How can you be sure? Maybe the trees you two 'I was here' marks on have all been cut down, and the things buried under them have been cleared away."

Wang Qiongqiong looked at Han Yuzhi: "Azhi, do you remember?"

Han Yuzhi shook her head: "I don't even know when you carved it."

Wang Qiongqiong scratched her head, remembering now. It seemed she secretly did it while Azhi was resting, planning to surprise her later.

Liu Pei, "Why don't you just tell me what you put there?"

Wang Qiongqiong refused, "No, let's find it first."

Liu Pei, "What if we can't find it?"

Wang Qiongqiong raised her fist, "What did you say?"

Liu Pei, "...Let me look again."

"Hey, I remember there's an abandoned pavilion on the mountaintop, and a stone deer next to it."

"......"

Liu Pei stared at her expressionlessly.

Wang Qiongqiong realized what was going on and casually pulled Han Yuzhi forward.

Han Yuzhi, "Let's just leave it to fate."

So, the group randomly chose a pavilion that looked like it, but when they reached the mountaintop, there was nothing there—not even a stone, let alone a pavilion.

Fortunately, the scenery was beautiful, so the climb wasn't a waste, and Liu Pei was lucky enough to avoid being scolded.

The group simply spread out blankets on the flat grass, relieving themselves of their burdens, and finally able to unload the snacks they had brought.

"Hey, Zhizhi, what's that? It even has flowers inside its fruit," Wang Qiongqiong said, munching on potato chips and looking around, pointing to the bushes not far away.

Liu Pei, "Aren't you going to stay still?"

"What, you're just looking at the scenery? Are you listening to me?" Wang Qiongqiong retorted, not to be outdone.

Han Yuzhi walked over to take a look. The plant had opposite, ovate-cordate leaves with tapering tips. The corolla was white with pinkish grooves and soft hairs; it was quite beautiful.

"This is *Radix Rosa laevigata*, also known in ancient times as *Wanlan*. In the *Classic of Poetry*, it was used to symbolize the virtues of a gentleman."

Wang Qiongqiong became even more curious. She walked over and picked a flower, looking at the unremarkable little bloom. "That's it? The ancients really had a vivid imagination."

Liu Pei also picked it up and examined it closely. "It's nothing special."

Wang Qiongqiong looked at it… "Yeah, you're not good enough for me, that's for sure."

Liu Pei got angry. What did that mean? Was he saying he lacked gentlemanly manners? "...You surnamed Wang, can't even shut your mouth with food?"

He simply pulled out a deck of cards. "Come on, let's take a break and play a couple of rounds."

"You've thought of that quite thoroughly."

"Of course, I'm so shrewd!"

"Have you found it convenient to bring me along when you go out? It's really great for traveling."

"...A keychain," Chen Xingji suddenly interjected from the side.

"..."

Liu Pei, "Anyway, remember not to forget us next time you come out to play," said he, pulling a large white slip of paper from his bag.

This time, even Yu Zibo and Han Yuzhi were speechless.

"How boring are you?"

Liu Pei: "What do you know? Playing cards is only fun when there's a stake. Hurry up, don't waste my hard work!"

Yu Zibo: "Just study. You have so many other thoughts."

Liu Pei: "Studying is tiring enough; I don't have time for anything else."

"......" That makes sense.

The card game begins.

Wang Qiongqiong blew on the slip of paper dangling in front of her, feeling frustrated. She was losing the worst. Not only was she worse than Yu Zibo, but Liu Pei was also worse off.

"Azhi, you go first," Wang Qiongqiong moved aside, determined not to be the only one losing so badly, or she would definitely become someone's laughingstock.

Han Yuzhi lay on another blanket, peeking at the blue sky and white clouds through her fingers. She glanced at the results, then sat down indifferently.

Liu Pei, now a little cocky, chuckled, "What, looking for help? Haha, useless."

Yu Zibo glanced at him, thought for a moment, and then said nothing.

The game continued. Liu Pei's smile gradually shifted from bright to stiff to wooden; he was almost out of space to stick the cards on his face. Meanwhile, Wang Qiongqiong's expression went from sullen to bursting into laughter, her infectious laughter echoing everywhere.

Liu Pei, unable to bear it any longer, said, "That's enough, isn't it?"

Yu Zibo and Han Yuzhi occasionally stuck one or two cards on their faces.

He resignedly stuck on another note,

“That's too much! It's just a game, why do you two have to make it such a brain-teasing game?”

Han Yuzhi blinked, shaking her head innocently.

“What do you mean?”

“It means I don’t need to put in so much effort to deal with you,” Wang Qiongqiong deliberately provoked him.

Yu Zibai’s lips twitched, “It’s just a test of short-term memory.”

Liu Pei felt a chill run down his spine, “Ugh… I hate memorizing things.”

“Hehehe, some people have finally realized their limitations.”

Liu Pei scoffed at her, “You’re even worse than me.”

Wang Qiongqiong, “I know my limitations, so even though physics is difficult, I still chose science.”

Speechless.

Finally, Yu Zibo and Han Yuzhi were eliminated due to their abilities, leaving Liu Pei to face Wang Qiongqiong. Chen Xingji stepped in to start the game again.

"You weren't so great either, huh?" Wang Qiongqiong said cheerfully, looking at the new paper strips pasted on Liu Pei's face.

Liu Pei was annoyed. This wasn't what he expected. How could her terrible card skills be on par with his? He could only attribute it to luck.

Han Yuzhi and Yu Zibo glanced at Chen Xingji discreetly, exchanging a knowing look but saying nothing.

In the end, all three had their faces covered in paper strips, and only then did they begin their descent. It was past lunchtime, but they weren't hungry anymore, so they decided to continue playing for a while.

Finally, we decided to go for a lake cruise.

The lake is quite large, located towards the back of the scenic area. The water is crystal clear, shimmering brilliantly in the sunlight.

A row of colorful boats was moored at the pier, and people were boarding one after another in the queue.

"Manual, foot, or automatic?"

"Automatic, I don't want to be too tired."

After cruising the lake, we headed straight to the food street, eating our way through it all while strolling leisurely.

"This is what life is all about! Too bad I have to go to school tomorrow."

"Can you shut up? Don't ruin my good mood."

The snacks here blend northern and southern flavors; there's bound to be something for everyone.

Wang Qiongqiong: "Azhi, come try this potsticker, it's delicious!"

Han Yuzhi: "I'll have one."

"Hey, do you still have this duck oil sesame seed cake? It tastes like the ones I ate when I was little. This is local."

Liu Pei: "Is this jianbing guozi (Chinese crepe) the flavor of your B City?"

Yu Zibo shook his head. "This is from T City. Theirs is the most authentic. They use mung bean flour, and the ingredients are simpler. B City uses mixed grain flour, but the ingredients are richer, and the texture is more varied."

"This fried cake is also delicious, but it's a bit sticky."

"..."

"It's so delicious, it's a shame I only have one stomach," Wang Qiongqiong rubbed her slightly round belly.

"Ah Zhi, want some more?"

Han Yuzhi shook her head. "That's enough. Maybe next time. What about you guys?"

Yu Zibo also shook his head. He ate the least; he rarely ate this kind of thing.

They ate happily and played joyfully. A youthful outing, ending on a delightful journey.
