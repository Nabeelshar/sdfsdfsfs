Chapter Six

Physical education class for Class 1, Grade 11 was a rare moment of relaxation for them.

It was free time again, and everyone familiarly headed to the equipment room.

Han Yuzhi and Wang Qiongqiong lagged behind, chatting leisurely.

By the time they arrived, most of the students had already left. The equipment room had most of the usual sports equipment, so the two weren't in a hurry.

Physical education class was great in every way, except that you weren't allowed to sit still; you had to be active. The PE teacher really went to great lengths.

"Yuzhi, what should we play?"

Han Yuzhi looked around. "Anything is fine."

"Volleyball? Forget it, my elbows hurt from playing too much," Wang Qiongqiong patted the volleyball and walked around it.

"Badminton? Too much for my arms." Another no-go.

"Ping pong? How about it?"

Han Yuzhi walked over, picked up the paddle, and examined it. It looked quite new.

"Sure."

"Never mind, it's indoors, too much trouble," Wang Qiongqiong rejected the idea herself.

Han Yuzhi, "...", sure enough, here we go again.

"Hey, tennis? I haven't played much," Wang Qiongqiong said, noticing the tennis rackets on the shelf to her right. She suddenly put her ping-pong ball down on the table and turned to go over, but then suddenly felt like she'd stepped on something and lurched forward. Han Yuzhi stepped forward to steady her, but Wang Qiongqiong bumped into her, causing her to slip and lose control of her body. Just as she thought she was about to fall, a strong hand caught her around the waist. Her heart skipped a beat, and she stumbled before regaining her balance. Looking up, she saw a handsome, charming face and deep, dark eyes. For a moment, time seemed to stand still.

The two stared at each other for a moment.

"Ouch!" Wang Qiongqiong's cry of pain brought their attention back.

Yu Zibai watched as she regained her footing, then slowly withdrew his hand. "Are you alright?" his voice was calm yet slightly different.

Han Yuzhi shook her head. "I'm fine," she said, then looked at Wang Qiongqiong.

Wang Qiongqiong was sitting on the ground with a thud, and a pair of hands were outstretched beside her, seemingly wanting to help, proving that her supervisor had indeed tried to assist.

Wang Qiongqiong slapped away the hand that was getting in her way, rubbed her bottom, and slowly stood up. Looking to the side, she said, "Liu Pei, did you do that on purpose?"

Liu Pei also felt wronged. "You weren't steady enough, I was just trying to help."

"Did you even help?"

"Well, you weren't very strong."

"You were just making things worse!" It all happened in an instant. Wang Qiongqiong instinctively reached for the nearest table, but Liu Pei suddenly reached out, and she instinctively grabbed it, then still ended up sitting down with a thud.

"What are you doing reaching your hand over there? Just for show?"

"You have the nerve to say that without using any effort yourself?"

"Do I even need to use any effort? Look at your own stance!"

"...." Okay, Liu Pei guiltily touched his nose. He really only meant to help her up; it was too late to pull her up properly.

"Blame the culprit," she said, picking up a flattened ping-pong ball from the ground.

"Who is it? They can't even put the ball properly," Wang Qiongqiong said, annoyed.

Han Yuzhi silently picked up a slightly cracked ping-pong ball from under her feet, gesturing to her that the culprit was right there.

"..."

"You have the nerve to criticize others? Why were you in such a hurry yourself?" Liu Pei finally had a legitimate reason.

"Forget it, let's go, let's go play ball," she thought. She couldn't very well say she thought the guy surnamed Liu also wanted to play tennis.

Between her tennis and basketball games, Wang Qiongqiong watched the boys next door playing basketball with great enthusiasm through the net.

The tennis court and basketball court were both in a large enclosure, separated only by a thin wire fence about a meter wide.

Most of the boys in her class were playing basketball there.

"I didn't realize Yu Zibai, usually so polite and well-mannered, could be so fierce on the court!"

Han Yuzhi turned her head and saw Yu Zibai leap and shoot, his body slender and upright.

Han Yuzhi called out, "Qiongqiong, get the ball!" She didn't want the PE teacher to notice her.

Wang Qiongqiong resignedly went to retrieve the ball; playing tennis was tiring.

Just as Wang Qiongqiong bent down to get up, she heard Azhi shout, "Get out of the way!"

Instinctively, she dodged to the side, a basketball narrowly missing her.

"......&amp;@" A string of profanities almost escaped her lips.

Looking towards the adjacent basketball court, she saw that the few people who had been playing so enthusiastically were either looking at the sky or the ground; not a single one of them was paying attention to her.

Very well, they're all good at pretending.

Han Yuzhi helplessly shrugged at her, having only seen the ball flying from that direction.

Wang Qiongqiong glanced at Chen Xingji not far away. He glanced at her, then silently turned away.

Very good!!!

“Hey Liu, you come over here!”

Liu Pei, who seemed lost in thought, jolted awake, his eyes widening as he looked around.

The others gave him helpless looks; not betraying him was already a favor to their companions. Who knew how the others knew?

Liu Pei stubbornly denied it. “Hey, we can’t just falsely accuse someone!”

“Just tell me, was it you?” A death stare. Try to deny it again.

Yu Zibo gave him a look; better confess quickly.

Liu Pei, "...Okay, it slipped, definitely not on purpose," quickly admitted his mistake.

"That's it?" Wang Qiongqiong glared at him.

"Then what do you want?"

"Simple, let me throw it too."

"Hey, I didn't hit you."

"Is that an excuse? Whether you hit it or not is up to you." Wang Qiongqiong took a few steps towards the net.

The other basketball players all chimed in,

"Peizi, let her throw it, it's okay."

"...Yeah, her aim isn't that good."

"Let her vent her anger quickly, then we can continue."

Liu Pei could only agree helplessly on the surface, inwardly chuckling to himself, *I saw it, could I not dodge? It's just a waste of energy.* Wang Qiongqiong didn't care about anything else. She picked up the basketball, aimed at Liu Pei's position, and hurled it at him with all her might.

Unfortunately, his jumping ability was too good; he dodged the ball with ease.

"Hehe, it's a deal!" Liu Pei caught the ball and patted it triumphantly on the ground.

"...Peizi, watch out!"

"...Quick, crouch down!"

But it was too late. The tennis ball hit him squarely on the head, a perfect shot.

"...Ouch...ah!" Liu Pei clutched his head, looking at the tennis ball still bouncing on the ground.

"Wang, you have no sportsmanship! You actually attacked me by sneak!"

Wang Qiongqiong laughed heartily, "Sorry, I hit it the wrong way."

Finally, she'd gotten all the old and new grudges out at once—it felt great.

Several girls who had gathered around laughed along.

Yu Zibo glanced at Han Yuzhi, who seemed to sense something. She casually switched hands, pretending not to have passed the ball, as if she hadn't been the one to serve.

Liu Pei silently turned around, feigning a headache, and squatted down. She then silently picked up the tennis ball her teammate had kicked back, quickly stood up, and turned to throw the ball.

Unfortunately, Wang Qiongqiong was prepared and dodged it with a slight movement.

Very well, it seems things can't end well here.

A fierce battle was about to erupt. What started as Wang Qiongqiong and Liu Pei were throwing balls at each other, with a group of helpers passing and retrieving the balls. But somehow, it had devolved into a chaotic free-for-all.

Both men and women were throwing balls back and forth, like volleyball, basketball, tennis, and even badminton.

Han Yuzhi watched speechlessly, retrieving the balls with incredible speed.

"...Watch the ball!"

"...If you're so good, don't dodge!"

"Please, improve your aim!"

"These women are crazy!"

They mocked and ridiculed each other, their hands and mouths never stopping.

No one present could escape; passively or actively, they were forced into this battle, each displaying their own skills.

When the PE teacher arrived, the scene on the field was incredibly lively, and he was instantly speechless.

Everyone was trying to stand out, but none of them showed any mercy to the girls. It seems the school doesn't need to worry about their relationships interfering with their studies; they're better off staying single. Look at this whole spectacle.

Looking at the clearly defined two sides, he stood casually in the middle, scanning back and forth.

"Tell me, what's going on?"

Liu Wei immediately spoke up as the representative, "Hehe, teacher, we were just joking around."

"I have eyes," he thought, trying to get away with it? Dream on.

"Teacher, it's like this, we just learned about the law of conservation of momentum in physics class, and we were just checking each other's work," Zhang Qingyun, standing next to him, made up an excuse on the spot.

The entire audience remained silent.

Teacher: Although I teach physical education, I still went to university through the proper college entrance examination.

The result of treating the teacher like an idiot was that everyone had to run laps around the track.
