Chapter Four

Han Yuzhi finished watering the plants in the nearby garden with the hose and moved a few potted plants to a shady spot.

“Grandma, I’m going to check on Grandpa.”

“Oh, he should be back soon for dinner. I’m not expecting his fish,” a soft, warm voice came from the kitchen.

“Okay,” Han Yuzhi replied with a smile.

Han Yuzhi walked slowly along the path where greenery met the earth, each step carrying the rhythm of nature. Wildflowers bloomed profusely on both sides, the greenery was lush, the blue sky was clear, and white clouds drifted lazily, as if they could wash away the worries of the world.

Located near the suburbs, this place is quiet and peaceful, far from the hustle and bustle. A few houses stand gracefully nestled among the greenery, resembling a simple poem by nature.

Here, time seems to slow down. Walking through it, one can almost hear the voice of their own heart and appreciate the beauty of life—it feels like a secluded paradise.

If Wang Qiongqiong hadn't called early this morning to remind her to go back today and not forget tomorrow's 'learning' activity, she would have loved to stay a couple more days.

Upon reaching the lake, they witnessed a crime scene:

Grandpa Li, his hair slightly graying, had nimbly slipped a fish from a bucket while his grandfather was talking to the neighbor. He was certain his grandfather had caught it out of the corner of his eye.

Well, it seemed Grandma's worries were unfounded; there were still fish, and probably not a few missing.

Han Yuzhi pretended not to see it, deliberately slowing her pace as she leisurely passed by.

"Grandpa!" Han Qinfeng turned around, saw his granddaughter, and smiled. "Zhizhi, come here, look at the fish Grandpa caught!"

"Hello, Grandpa Li! Hello, Grandpa Wang!" Han Yuzhi greeted them. Grandpa Li was standing, still looking tall and thin, while Grandpa Wang sat on the other side, a little chubby, with a beaming smile.

"Zhizhi, it's been a while since I've seen you. Have you grown taller again..."

"Hey, that's not right. I clearly caught three, how come there are only two?" Han Qinfeng looked puzzled.

Grandpa Li, pretending to shout loudly, called out, "Old Qin, you're mistaken! You think it's my bucket?"

Han Qinfeng looked at the bucket beside him and, sure enough, there were three fish. He looked at his own bucket again, seemingly still not believing it.

"Old Li, when did you catch them?"

"While you were chatting, don't try to cheat! You promised to play chess with me this afternoon if you lost!"

Han Yuzhi pouted silently beside him.

"No, I didn't know how, but I promised my wife I'd have fish for lunch, and this is it."

Han Qinfeng sighed, "Alas, it seems it's not enough."

"Simple, you can have all of mine," Grandpa Li readily offered up the fish from his bucket.

Han Qinfeng politely accepted the fish and quickly poured it into his bucket. "That's so kind of you."

"It's alright. My wife doesn't really like fish. It's a deal, no take-backs."

"Of course, no take-backs!" Han Qinfeng was delighted, shaking the bucket of fish. Hmm, more than expected, braised fish—he could make fish soup too.

Grandpa Li was also happy; finally, he had someone to play with again.

Grandpa Wang, standing nearby: Old Qin, you're willing to play chess with this lousy chess player just for fish. You've really gone to a lot of trouble.

Han Yuzhi: Yes, Grandpa's days are always this joyful.

When Grandma He Huifang took the fish bucket Han Yuzhi brought back and saw the fish inside, she instinctively asked,

"Why did you catch so many today?"

"Well, I caught more to nourish Zhizhi," Han Qinfeng replied calmly, washing his hands.

He Huifang looked at him suspiciously, "Did you trick Old Li again?"

Han Qinfeng secretly winked at his granddaughter, "Oh, Old Li and the others don't eat fish for lunch, so they gave me some."

He Huifang: Sure enough, with your skills, it's impossible for the fish to be particularly obedient today.

"Ziyi, we can also make a soup," He Huifang said to the kitchen maid.

"Yes, soup is quick," Ziyi's voice was a little rough and slow.

...

"Auntie's soup is so delicious," Han Yuzhi sipped her soup slowly, remarking with appreciation. Her family's Aunt An's soup was also delicious, but it lacked a certain flavor—perhaps it was because of what she'd grown up with.

"If it's good, drink more. Auntie will make it for you again next time you come," Aunt Ziyi said happily. Her voice was a little rough, and she spoke slowly. Actually younger than her grandmother, she had fled from the south and had no relatives left. She had been with her for decades, practically watching Han Yuzhi grow up.

"Is your maternal grandmother adjusting well?" Han Qinfeng asked.

Han Yuzhi nodded. "My grandma called before and nagged a lot, but I could tell she was still very happy."

Han Qinfeng nodded. "Your aunt has been gone for many years now, hasn't she?"

"Yes, my mom and grandma don't force her to come back."

"Right, anywhere is fine, as long as she's happy." Grandma agreed. If this place still bothers her, then she shouldn't make things difficult for herself. Life is just the simple routine of daily necessities; she doesn't strive for perfection, but rather for peace of mind.

"This reading room in your neighborhood is nice," Wang Qiongqiong and the others noticed as they entered, seeing a row of tables and chairs arranged neatly by the window. The sunlight streamed in softly, not harsh, but rather illuminating the bright and clean interior. Two rows of bookshelves lined the walls, sparsely stocked with magazines, presumably casually provided by the property management.

"Tsk tsk, definitely worth the price," the environment was excellent.

Han Yu and the others were quite surprised, as it was their first time here.

"Wow, after living here for so long, I only just discovered this gem," Liu Pei remarked, a little astonished after looking around.

Wang Qiongqiong scoffed, "You? What are you doing here, cleaning?"

"..." Oh no, Wang Qiongqiong's been on fire.

He nudged Chen Xingji. What was wrong with her? She was like a powder keg this morning.

Chen Xingji thought for a moment, “...Resentment towards the rich?”

“......” Hmph.

“Azhi, come help me with this question. Xiao Zhao is really going too far, assigning so much biology homework!” Wang Qiongqiong put down her schoolbag and hurried to finish her homework; she'd been too busy playing these past few days.

Liu Pei couldn't care less either; he had to finish his homework today, otherwise he'd have to struggle on his own tomorrow night.

When the others saw Liu Pei's remaining homework, they were speechless. Even though Wang Qiongqiong had been playing a lot, she had still done some of her homework.

Yu Zibo glanced at it, “Has your schoolbag been unopened since the start of the holiday?”

Liu Pei wasn't embarrassed at all; "The capable should do more."

Wang Qiongqiong rolled her eyes. This guy had been copying homework since the first year of high school, and with that attitude, he still hadn't been kicked out of the top class. It was infuriating!

Chen Xingji, watching Liu Pei's rapid pace, was speechless. "Is this method, with its haphazard steps, appropriate?"

Liu Pei, eyes fixed on the exam paper, muttered to himself, still managing to answer in a spare moment:

"It's not an exam. This way, it's easier for the teacher to read."

Chen Xingji was speechless. "Pretty proficient."

Wang Qiongqiong said, "Sometimes, the teacher needs to express their gratitude."

Liu Pei replied, "Efficiency is everything now."

Then, with equally high efficiency, he moved on to the next paper.

Han Yuzhi and Yu Zibo were actually about the same; they had both been dragged along.

Wang Qiongqiong finally finished her most hated subject, physics. She only fully understood the last question after Han Yuzhi explained it to her.

"This is almost as difficult as a competition! It's so unfriendly!"

She stretched. "What time is it?"

Han Yuzhi put down her book. "It's almost lunchtime."

Liu Pei also stopped writing. "How about we eat first?" He was quite tired from concentrating so much on his homework this morning.

No one objected.

"Come on, it's my treat today. The rice bowl place near the entrance of the complex is pretty good."

After lunch, the group strolled back leisurely.

"Come on, Yuzhi, let's play a couple of games. I just saw a ping-pong table over there," Wang Qiongqiong said, rubbing her stomach. Han Yuzhi said nonchalantly, "You brought the camera?"

"Hey Liu, you have one, right? Go get it."

"Is this how you beg?"

"Heh, you haven't realized your place in the scene today," he said, glancing at Han Yuzhi's backpack.

Liu Pei immediately replied, "Understood, I'll go get it right away. You guys go ahead."

He hurried home, worried that if he didn't agree to what that guy had done to him that afternoon, he might cause trouble.

The ping-pong table was in the activity room, connected to the reading room by a corridor. It was practically empty at this hour; there was only one table.

Han Yuzhi and Wang Qiongqiong played for a while, but Liu Pei, eager for more, quickly took their place. Wang Qiongqiong then played with Chen Xingji for a bit, but not satisfied, they switched to doubles. The combinations were a chaotic mess, but surprisingly, Han Yuzhi and Yu Zibai had the best teamwork and scored the most points.

"Hey, does this have to do with intelligence?" Liu Pei wondered. "This is my buddy, this shouldn't be happening."

"It's probably about brains. With all your energy and no brains, how can you not lose?" Wang Qiongqiong firmly believed Liu Pei was holding them back.

"One's offense is good, the other's defense is tight," Chen Xingji, observing more clearly, noted.

"Forget it, let's not dwell on it anymore, let's keep fighting."

The group dispersed, some reading, some doing their homework.

Han Yuzhi sat on the soft sofa in the middle, looking at the book she had been reading. She had just turned to the last page when Yu Zibo came over.

"Finished reading? Do you have any other books by this author?"

Yu Zibo took the book, flipped through it, thought for a moment, and nodded. "I also have a book of essays."

Han Yuzhi exclaimed, "Great!"

Yu Zibo waved the book in his hand. "You like reading this kind of book?"

Han Yuzhi shook her head. "I don't have any particular hobbies. I just happened to see this one, and it's become a habit to want to read more of their work."

After all, books are the vehicles for writers' thoughts. They transform intangible ideas into tangible words, allowing those thoughts to transcend the boundaries of time and space, resonating in the hearts of every reader. Reading is a process of gradually understanding a writer. Sometimes, when you encounter something that resonates with you, you can't help but read more, to read more of their work.

However, she now genuinely enjoys reading this author's books; she can almost feel the historical traces of that era through them.

"You like reading this kind of book too?" This was what Han Yuzhi was more curious about.

Yu Zibo shook his head. "My mom likes reading."

Han Yuzhi was a little embarrassed. "...Is that okay?"

Yu Zibo smiled. "It's alright," and didn't plan to let her know for the time being.
