Chapter 6 This Dog Has a Problem

From birth, a monster possesses at least one weakness, sometimes an object, sometimes a person with whom it has a strong causal relationship.

The monster lying on the hospital bed before them wasn't particularly strong, but it had a multitude of weaknesses. An Baixin was one of them.

If anyone else attacked it, it would only suffer ordinary damage.

But if it were someone with a strong causal connection, such as this old man's son and daughter-in-law, it would be a critical hit.

Unfortunately, the other three people were successfully assimilated and corrupted, increasing the monster's power. Only An Baixin remained conscious.

Therefore, when she raised her knife to fight back, the small scalpel even severed her entire tongue.

"Aaaaaahhhhh!!!" the monster howled, covering its mouth, and its fusion with the other three accelerated. In seconds, the three completely lost their human form, with only their arms and legs dangling out. As the monster howled, these seemingly detached arms and legs twitched.

Having merged, the three's bizarre strength increased dramatically, and their tongues instantly regenerated. They sent An Baixin flying, crashing into a nearby hospital bed and landing on the floor.

An Baixin gritted her teeth and got up, only to find that the monster before her had grown to the hospital ceiling.

The hospital room door banged loudly, with mutated individuals frantically pounding on it like zombies.

Qin Xian kicked a cabinet against the door, blocking it with his bare foot.

Although these things weren't particularly strong, once they were merged with the larger monster, the situation would become much more complicated.

Qin Xian held the bone in one hand and pulled out three scalpels in the other. His index finger braced against the handle, he flicked his wrist, sending the scalpels flying like throwing knives, piercing the strange creature's eye.

Next, the heart.

The next, the throat.

The strange creature, its vocal cords ruptured, let out a "ha, ha" sound, its legs thrashing wildly in pain. It looked a bit like a grasshopper being squeezed.

Without the scalpels, Qin Xian picked up the bone again, leaped onto the hospital bed, and smashed it down on the strange creature's forehead.

"Crack."

The bone broke.

"Ah, what a pity." The dog's treat was gone.

Qin Xian reacted swiftly, slashing the broken end of the bone into the eerie eyeball.

The sharp bone easily pierced the fragile crystal, penetrating five or six centimeters deep. Using it for leverage, Qin Xian kicked off the scalpel in the throat.

The scalpel and handle were now completely submerged in the throat.

An Baixin, in the corner, gasped.

Just imagining it made her throat ache.

This eerie creature was a tangible, humanoid monster, easily killed with physical attacks, and its weaknesses were essentially the same as humans'.

The throat and eyes were already severely injured, but protecting his heart was even more crucial.

In a bizarre struggle, he desperately reached for the scalpel that was slightly embedded in his heart, but Qin Xian was faster. After landing, Qin Xian grabbed a nearby thermos and smashed it down on the scalpel handle.

Now, the last fatal weakness was pierced by the scalpel.

"Boom! Boom! Boom!"

The bizarre roar of pain erupted in a final act of resistance, frantically flailing its tongue, hands, and legs, smashing everything in the ward it could overturn or break at Qin Xian.

It even tried to tear the ceiling down.

Fragments flew through the room, cutting wounds on Qin Xian's face and arms, narrowly missing his eyes.

"Tsk. Let's go." Qin Xuan quickly jumped off the bed, grabbed An Baixin's clothes, and dragged her out of the ward.

An Baixin staggered out, panting, and followed Qin Xuan through several wards before stopping.

She leaned against the wall, breathing heavily, listening to the struggle sounds in the distance gradually diminish until they disappeared completely.

The dim lights in the corridor flickered, gradually regaining their brightness.

Qin Xuan stood in the flickering light, his breathing steady as he brushed the dirt off his clothes.

"Congratulations on surviving! What are your plans now?"

An Baixin looked bewildered. "I don't know. I don't even understand what happened. What will happen to them?"

Qin Xian calmly replied, "They're dead. Congratulations. If your father-in-law doesn't have a wife or other children, you'll likely inherit his estate."

An Baixin hadn't expected this topic to be brought up and replied blankly, "It seems... it seems like I don't have any other relatives."

"So what are you planning to do?"

"Well, if I can really get the money... I want to open a dessert shop... I want to have my own life. I don't want to consider marriage anytime soon. Maybe I'll get a dog."

Qin Xian smiled. "Indeed, a dog won't betray its owner. I wish you success. Your life can have a new beginning. Of course, if you still miss those people in that house, then pretend I didn't say anything."

These words were indeed direct. An Baixin quickly waved her hands and shook her head: "No, I won't be like that anymore. Um, thank you so much for saving me, I'm really so grateful. May I ask your name?"

Qin Xian replied, "My surname is Qin. If you want to thank me, buy me a bag of dog food."

"Oh? Oh, no problem, ten bags are fine too. Mr. Qin, do you also have a dog?"

"No, I just found it. Do you want it? Didn't you want to get a dog?" Qin Xian asked.

An Baixin paused, then asked, "Huh? What breed is it? I'd be happy to adopt it."

Qin Xuan gestured, "A black dog, about this big, probably a medium to large breed. It looks like a mixed breed."

An Baixin hesitated, "Ah… I'd probably prefer a small dog, like a Bichon Frise."

Qin Xuan decisively gave up; his dog at home didn't seem friendly.

"That dog doesn't seem to suit you. Never mind, I need to go back and see it."

An Baixin nodded, "Then let's go see where the nearest pet store is. I'll buy you some pet supplies!"

A little over an hour later, Qin Xuan got out of the taxi carrying large bags. An Baixin was very enthusiastic, buying a huge pile of things from the pet store and stuffing them into his bag.

Seeing that he couldn't refuse, Qin Xian simply accepted it. He got into the taxi she had called and returned home.

He opened the door; the house was eerily quiet, not a sound to be heard, even with the lights on.

"Is it dead...?" Qin Xian hurried through the living room and saw through the glass that the dog on the balcony was sitting up, its head turned directly in his direction, staring intently without barking.

This dog was really not very endearing.

Qin Xian frowned.

But it could also be wary of strangers; this state was probably normal after being injured.

Qin Xian was too lazy to carefully protect it, and he wasn't afraid the dog might suddenly rush up and attack him.

He reached out and pushed open the balcony door.

The heavy, aged glass door creaked gratingly, making the dog's ears twitch.

Qin Xian placed two ceramic bowls on the ground, pouring water into one and some dog food into the other.

But the injured dog seemed completely uninterested in the food, not even lowering its head, its eyes fixed on Qin Xian.

Qin Xian squatted down, meeting its bored gaze.

The dog remained silent, not uttering a sound.

Qin Xian asked tentatively, "You're not a mute dog, are you? Pfft, bark for me."

The dog: "..."

"You were howling a few hours ago... Never mind, I brought you food, eat up." With that, he stood up and left, closing the balcony door behind him.

The dog seemed to have recovered; it wouldn't die. "Let's leave it for now and let it stay quiet."

Qin Xian took a shower, feeling refreshed, and returned to the living room to lie down on the sofa.

The soft foam snugly enveloped his back, finally easing his tense nerves.

Qin Xian stared at the ceiling, his dark pupils slightly unfocused in the light.

He was processing the information from the day.

According to the rules, only the final victor among those caught in the Infinite Flow world could return to the real world.

Everyone fought tooth and nail for that position.

When Qin Xian won, he was immediately besieged by the other players.

The main god opened the door for him to return, but the other players glared at him with hatred, jealousy, and madness.

The men swarmed at him like madmen, their faces contorted, shouting, "Why? Why can you go home?!"

In this state of mind, even if the gods said they had to have their hands and feet cut off to go back, they would agree without hesitation.

Especially since it was just to take a strange seed back.

In fact, this condition suited the already twisted psychology of some.

Why was he the only one dragged into this terrifying world? Why could everyone else live peacefully and happily?

Qin Xuan turned over slightly, recalling Xun Dawei's strange behavior when he escaped the police pursuit.

A normal person couldn't continuously dodge bullets like that. Did Xun Dawei retain his abilities from the Infinite Flow world, or did he gain power from the strange entity?

Qin Xuan looked at his palm, remaining silent for a moment. His palm showed no abnormality.

He couldn't summon his weapon again. But his "Insight" ability had recently returned.

Could it be that his abilities would gradually recover after returning? Why was this happening? Was the erosion of this world by the other side intensifying?

In any case, the peaceful life he had imagined was impossible.

"...This is fucking ridiculous."

Qin Xuan cursed.

But he would survive no matter what. Although he didn't want to become some kind of savior, he would definitely stop the strange entity. And, incidentally, he needed to earn some living expenses.

Qin Xian thought for a moment, then opened his phone and entered a part-time job forum, posting a strange message.

【Location: City A. Have you encountered anything strange lately? Contact me, I can help you solve it—Posted by: Q】

Staring at the post for a couple of seconds, Qin Xian couldn't help but laugh out loud.

He never imagined that after returning home, he would end up on the path of a charlatan in order to make money.

Putting down his phone, he sat up abruptly from the sofa… Suddenly, Qin Xian looked towards the balcony with a nervous alertness.

Through the glass door, the dog on the balcony was still watching him.

Its all-black fur almost blended into the night, only its eyes reflected the light.

For some reason, the light had a reddish tint.

This dog is strange.

Qin Xian frowned and stood up. The light shifted, and the dog across the glass tilted its head, its ears shifting slightly to one side.

It seemed merely a display of wariness and curiosity.

Qin Xian pushed open the balcony door and looked down at the dog.

The dog looked up to meet his gaze.

Qin Xian's eyes began to glow with gold, but then red blood vessels began to appear on his eyeballs.

After squeezing out two tears from his aching eyes, he covered his face and breathed slowly, enduring the sharp pain.

His "Insight" ability showed that the dog's appearance hadn't changed at all. This basically meant the dog wasn't some other strange mutation, but there was another possibility…

Its current appearance was its original form.
