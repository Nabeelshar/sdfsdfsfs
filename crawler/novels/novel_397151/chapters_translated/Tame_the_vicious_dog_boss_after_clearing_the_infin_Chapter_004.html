Chapter 4 Have the other players returned too?

The clock in the corridor had struck midnight. The hospital was eerily quiet. The nurses on duty and the guards had vanished, the empty corridor stretching out into the darkness.

“Thump, thump, thump!”

Fast footsteps approached. Something was running—perhaps a frightened human, or something else entirely.

“Thump, thump…”

Qin Xuan’s steps were as steady as his expression. He even had the leisure to peek through the observation window as he passed the wards.

Most of the beds in the wards were empty; the rooms were dark and unoccupied. This proved that the culprit’s abilities were average, unable to draw too many people into their domain.

It should be relatively easy to handle.

But only he would be easy; for the other living people, it was a completely different story.

The suspect, brought to the hospital, awoke from a nightmare to a red-glowing light above him.

The surroundings were eerily quiet, but he could hear countless murmurs mingling with his own heartbeat.

These murmurs came from men, women, young, and old. At first, they were hard to understand, but gradually, these groans of pain became clearer and clearer.

They cursed, begged, screamed, and finally merged into a scream that seemed to tear his very soul apart.

The man struggled to sit up, only to find his hands cuffed to the bed frame. The handcuffs clanged against the sturdy iron frame, and the man gripped the chains, pulling desperately, but they wouldn't budge.

Surprised by his movements, the surrounding murmurs and screams suddenly ceased.

The man froze as if a pause button had been pressed, holding his breath. But it was too late; countless eyes in the darkness turned in his direction.

'You look...so healthy, give us your body...'

The pause resumed abruptly. Ignoring the risk of broken wrists, the man painfully pulled at the handcuffs, making a clanging sound, but they remained firmly fastened to the bed frame.

"Aaaaah!! Let go! I won't groan! Can't you see my face is all shriveled? Don't come looking for me!! Damn it!!"

The overhead light grew dimmer and redder, and in the dim light, the walls rapidly darkened from the corners towards the center.

Something covered the entire wall.

Then, this black membrane pulsated, and screaming heads pressed against it, their facial contours clearly visible.

"Damn it! Ha, damn it!!!" The man changed position, trying to kick the iron railing hard with his foot. But this was clearly a foolish move; the instantaneous pain rendered him speechless, and he lay hunched over, seeing stars, for several seconds.

In those few seconds, dozens of human upper bodies had emerged from the wall, pushing against the black membrane until it was uneven, their outstretched fingertips seemingly about to burst through.

But the black membrane did not rupture. Several pairs of black hands suddenly gripped the bed rails. The bed frame began to shift, the metal legs scraping against the floor with a sharp sound.

"Aaaaaah!!!" The man screamed, trying to move towards the headboard, but the handcuffs held him firmly in place. He could only watch helplessly as countless hands drew closer and closer, almost poking his eyes.

"Bang!"

The ward door was suddenly flung open with tremendous force. The ghostly figures that had sprung out from the wall abruptly stopped, collectively turning their heads sharply towards the doorway.

The sunken eyes, veiled by black membranes, seemed to see, staring intently at the newcomer.

The man on the bed, realizing he had escaped, collapsed from exhaustion, his chin slamming heavily against the hard bed, aggravating his old injury.

Tears streamed down his face from the pain, but he forced back his screams and looked towards the door.

Due to his swollen and injured face, he could only make out that the person was a tall man wearing a black trench coat, carrying a white, gleaming object.

For some reason, he felt the object looked familiar.

'You're so healthy! You're even healthier!! Give me your body!!!'

The black, membrane-like figures on the wall suddenly screamed in unison, rapidly moving along the wall, their arms extending like rubber, reaching for Qin Xian.

Qin Xian stood still, but without fear. He even leisurely tossed the bone upwards; the bone spun twice in the air before he gripped it tightly, then cleaved it down from above, the three or four ghostly hands at the forefront sharply bending into a pointed angle.

'Aaaaaaahhhhhh!!!' "Ouch! Ouch! I'm broken! Broken! I don't want chiropractic, I don't want plates, it hurts so much!!!"

A series of screams rang out. These eerie creatures were mostly composed of the resentment of the dead, and those who had experienced the pain of a broken bone screamed even more horribly.

"You hurt me! You have to pay! You have to pay my medical bills and lost wages!!!"

The eerie creatures screamed as more of their bodies emerged, lunging at Qin Xian.

Qin Xian silently raised the bone.

The black figures paused for a moment, but their bloodthirsty instincts quickly took over, and they continued to charge.

Qin Xian sneered, hoisted the bone, and began to beat the ghosts, choosing not to strike vital areas, but rather the most painful spots. Knees, nose, chin, finger joints—the screams filled the entire hospital room like the eighteenth level of hell.

The man locked to the bed trembled uncontrollably at the sound.

Who on earth had suddenly appeared? Surely one of the top players on the game leaderboard? But which of those people used a stick?

He strained his eyes, but could only vaguely make out a mask on the other person's face; he couldn't make out their features at all.

In those few seconds of contemplation, Qin Xian had already forced the black-clad figures to retreat mostly into the wall, with only a few daring to peek out and bare their teeth at Qin Xian.

Qin Xian swung the bone club at the emerging creatures, but the club passed right through the black human bodies.

This was the strange characteristic of these creatures; they were vengeful spirits formed from the collective remains of numerous human deaths. When they swarmed, they could materialize and attack. However, after being attacked, they could revert to their phantom forms.

At this point, physical attacks alone were completely ineffective against them, making the situation extremely troublesome.

"Tsk, annoying bugs." Qin Xian ignored these lowest-level anomalies and turned to look at the bed information, asking, "Your name is Xun Dawei?"

The man on the bed nodded hurriedly, "Yes, my name is Xun Dawei, Brother, please save my life!!"

"I'm not that kind," Qin Xian replied coldly.

Xun Dawei bent even lower, almost lying on the bed, and asked, "Um, Big Brother, what do you want? I'll tell you everything!"

Qin Xuan asked, "How did you get out?"

"How did I get out? What do you mean…" Xun Dawei suddenly stopped, then shakily raised his finger and pointed at Qin Xuan, saying, "I know, I know who you are! You know that world, but you don't know our escape plan. You're Huang E! Isn't that right!!"

Qin Xuan's expression remained indifferent, even though this man jokingly mispronounced his "mysterious" title as "Huang E."

He said coldly, "Answer my question."

"Hahahaha!!" Xun Dawei laughed loudly, "You're wondering, aren't you? You're wondering why, even though the God said only Li Yi (the first one) could leave, you risked your life to get Li Yi, only to find that we losers are out too. I won't tell you the reason unless you take me to a safe place and help me evade the police!"

He roared incoherently, blood seeping from the bandages on his face again.

Qin Xuan turned around, took a few steps back, and stood at the head of the bed. He said to the black membrane on the wall, "I can't give you my body. But this person is of no use anymore, so I'll give him to you."

'Really? Giving him to us?'

The black membrane on the wall stirred, and several figures emerged again, reaching out towards Xun Dawei on the bed. Xun Dawei struggled fiercely: "Don't you want to know the answer?! Huang E, I'll fucking kill you! You think you're so cool, huh? You're just an ordinary person now! But some players are different. If they find you, you'll die a horrible death... Ah! Don't eat me! Xuan, I'll tell you how we left, how we got rid of them!"

Qin Xuan sneered: "The Supreme God promised you something, didn't he? For example, he could let you leave, but you must bring the Strange back with you."

Xun Dawei suddenly froze, his mouth agape, unable to say anything.

"Just as I thought, the Supreme God has a good grasp of the darkness of human nature." Qin Xuan took a step forward, getting closer to Xun Dawei.

The bizarre creatures, which were about to devour people, all stopped in their tracks, their blind heads following Qin Xian's movements. They couldn't understand Qin Xian's plan and dared not act rashly.

Qin Xian continued, "You hate that only I was able to return, and you hate the ordinary people who live safely here. Why are you the only ones who are unlucky? Even if it means becoming traitors to humanity, you're happy to bring the bizarre creatures into this world, aren't you?"

"You...you, what's wrong with you again! You're right, but I'm not wrong either! Is it wrong for me to want to live!?" Xun Dawei's neck stiffened, his face flushed with agitation.

Qin Xian snorted coldly, "Who cares about you? Go tell that to the police."

Before Xun Dawei could understand, he saw a white bone swing towards his head again.

"No! 'Seed Paper'! I'll tell you about the seed paper!"

The bone stopped just in time. Qin Xian asked, "Seeds?"

Xun Dawei stammered, "Powerful monsters can't directly enter this world. They turned into seed paper and were brought here. As for the others, I... damn it!"

Before he could utter a single word, Qin Xian knocked him unconscious with a blow, and he fell headfirst to the ground.

Pre-order #2: Title: "Everyone Around Me is My Summoned Beast!?" 》

Synopsis: This synopsis was saved in email on June 19, 2025.

Shen Rui transmigrated into a Western fantasy world, becoming a newly enrolled summoner.

Magic is difficult to learn, and summoning beasts is impossible. Shen Rui found the days particularly unbearable, sitting in the classroom imagining:

The beautiful and gentle teacher on the podium looked like a heterochromatic curly-haired cat; the top student next to him looked like a wise golden retriever; and the arrogant and domineering rich kid looked like an enraged hamster.

In his final assessment before being expelled, Shen Rui casually waved his staff and chanted a spell, successfully summoning a beautiful heterochromatic-eyed cat.

The cat looked bewildered and confused, then stumbled and fell hard.


Shen Rui quickly scooped up the cat and gave it a big kiss: "You're my first summoned beast, don't break it!"

Then, he summoned a puzzled golden retriever, a squeaking hamster, a sharp-eyed peregrine falcon… but why did these summoned beasts look more and more like the people around him?
