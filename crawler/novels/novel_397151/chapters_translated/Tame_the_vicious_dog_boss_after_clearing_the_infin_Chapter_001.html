Chapter 1 First Official Release…

The office air was stifling and sticky, carrying the smell of cheap, poor-quality building materials. Rows of desks were occupied by expressionless people, the sounds of keyboards and mice clicking incessantly, yet not a single word was spoken.

Qin Xuan frowned at the computer screen. Unfamiliar documents, incomprehensible charts, and the 99+ WeChat message notifications were irritating.

The computer screen flickered twice, then suddenly turned crimson. Thick blood surged on the screen, the task bar below submerged in bloody tears, and a trash can icon overturned, a ghostly hand reaching out.

Qin Xuan jerked back, the chair sliding a few centimeters across the floor with a sharp scraping sound. The sound instantly snapped him back to reality, but in the blink of an eye, everything around him returned to normal.

The others turned to glance at him upon hearing the sound, but upon recognizing him as an unfamiliar colleague, they immediately turned back to their keyboards, numbly continuing to type. Bright sunlight streamed onto the floor, and the air conditioner whirred loudly.

What's wrong? Has he been in the endless loop for too long and lost his mind? He clearly finished the game and successfully returned to the real world.

"Hey, Qin Xian? Are you alright? Your face is so pale, are you having low blood sugar?"

The bespectacled male colleague sitting next to him handed him a candy. Qin Xian looked up, and his colleague was immediately stunned.

Huh? Qin Xian's hair used to be this long? And this handsome? He vaguely remembered that Qin Xian, though good-looking, used to be withdrawn and always kept his head down, appearing unremarkable.

But now… his features were handsome yet aloof, even his furrowed brows were striking, giving him an unapproachable air.

His colleague froze for a moment: “Um, do you… want some candy?”

Qin Xian looked down at him, trying to be polite as before: “Thank you…”

But what was this person’s name again?

His memories of this job, this office, and all his colleagues were quite hazy. He only remembered that this lousy job often involved working 007, low pay, heavy workload, and an incompetent boss. He wouldn’t have stayed here if he hadn’t desperately needed money after graduating from university.

"Forget it, I'll just quit tomorrow."

Qin Xuan took the candy from his colleague, popped it into his mouth, leaned back in his chair, and started slacking off on his phone.

He'd been gone from this world for two years. He didn't know how the gods had managed to make him reappear so seamlessly two years later; even his colleagues hadn't noticed anything amiss, and his workstation was unchanged.

His colleague, blatantly slacking off, stared in horror, eyes wide. "Qin Xian, what are you doing? The security camera's on you! Slacking off at work costs four hundred yuan!"

Qin Xian didn't even flinch: "Go ahead and deduct it."

"Oh my god, that's four hundred yuan!"

"Four hundred? Doesn't the labor law apply here?"

"...But, sigh, never mind, I don't have the guts to go against the company." His colleague gave him a thumbs up and immediately turned back to stare at his computer.

But Qin Xian clearly saw that he was just sitting there staring blankly at the screen, typing a few words and then deleting them. There was even a fake TV drama ad pop-up in the lower right corner.

Clearly a master slacker, his computer screen was even slightly tilted, causing severe glare from the monitor's angle.

Qin Xuan continued to focus on his phone. Having only been away for two years, he was already out of touch with current internet slang and memes; even scrolling through short videos felt incredibly novel.

Take this video, for example. The characters' fingers were sticking together as they moved; one second they were dancing, the next three heads were glued together and merged into one… It was supposedly the latest AI technology, but some of the finished products looked similar to things he'd seen in the bizarre dungeons.

“Everyone assemble in the meeting room within three minutes!”

A gruff voice suddenly echoed throughout the office. His bespectacled colleague next to him jumped in surprise, pressing Win+D to switch to the computer desktop.

"What's going on? We're almost off work, and we still have a meeting?!"

"Sigh...you get used to it."

"I have to pick up my kid tonight."

His colleagues listlessly stood up and strolled out of the office in twos and threes. Qin Xian picked up his phone and blended into the crowd, entering the meeting room. Everyone handed in their phones and took their seats. Without the crowd obscuring his view, Qin Xian saw the "person" sitting across the long table. He instinctively summoned his weapon, but found nothing in his hand.

He calmly lowered his hand, found his seat with his colleagues, and continued to secretly observe what was happening across the table.

It was an abnormally obese man, slumped in a chair, panting heavily. His fat spilled onto the floor, a chunk of his belly reaching a colleague's feet, but the colleague seemed oblivious, head down, organizing documents.

Qin Xuan looked around; apart from him, no one else in the meeting room seemed to notice anything amiss.

He clenched his fists, his brow furrowed.

What was going on? Had he really not left the Infinite Flow World?! What new instance was this? That damned God was playing a trick on him!

"Qin Xian! Look up! I just saw it on the security camera—you were blatantly playing on your phone during work hours. Stand up and reflect on your actions!"

Qin Xian looked up, his dark eyes fixed on President Zhao, radiating murderous intent.

President Zhao shuddered comically, seemingly frozen in fear by that gaze.

"You, you…you're not convinced?!? You've gone too far! You're packing your bags and leaving tomorrow!"

He angrily slammed his hand on the table, his fat slapping against it with a sound that left a stain that was hard to tell if it was sweat or grease.

"Oh, fine." Qin Xian elegantly crossed his long legs, his tone calm, as if he were the boss of the office.

General Manager Zhao was so angry that his entire body trembled. He slammed his hand on the table, trying to stand up, but his bloated body prevented him from doing so; instead, he collapsed onto the metal chair.

With a loud crash, he sat down on the floor, his sparse head level with the tabletop.

The conference room was silent for a few seconds, then someone burst out laughing. Following this, the others couldn't hold back their laughter either.

"Hahahaha…"

"You! You bunch of bastards… Your entire performance bonus for this month is gone, completely gone!!" "

A colleague panicked and rushed to help Mr. Zhao, who had fallen to the ground. But the moment he reached out, Mr. Zhao grabbed his collar tightly.

"You just laughed, didn't you? I heard you! It was this mouth that laughed..."

He reached out and grabbed the colleague's face.

The colleague screamed immediately. Mr. Zhao's fingernails dug into his flesh, the force slowly tearing the skin around his mouth, blood spurting out.

This time, the others finally saw the horrific scene clearly. Some screamed in terror, others tried to rush out of the meeting room, but the door was locked from the inside and couldn't be opened.

Then..." At that moment, a figure suddenly leaped onto the desk.

He braced himself with his hands on the desk, and with a powerful kick, aimed directly at General Manager Zhao's face.

With that single kick, the massive General Manager Zhao, who probably weighed over 600 pounds, screamed and crashed backward, knocking over the whiteboard, coffee table, and other clutter behind him.

General Manager Zhao's fat seemed to have shielded him from most of the damage; he quickly and angrily scrambled to his feet, roaring as he scrambled up onto the desk, stretching out his arms to... They tried to grab Qin Xian. Faced with this sluggish attack, Qin Xian slightly dodged to the side, leaped off the conference table with a single push, and kicked Zhao Zong in the face.

The sound of breaking bones and a muffled scream rang out simultaneously, causing everyone else to shudder.

Zhao Zong's face caved in, screaming and trying to grab Qin Xian's foot, but Qin Xian's attack was relentless. He raised his foot and stomped down hard, not stopping even as the bones in his hand cracked horribly. A few kicks later, Mr. Zhao's enormous body rapidly shrank, returning to the size of a normal human.

He rolled on the ground, clutching his head with his twisted hands. His nose was sunken, several teeth were missing, and his face was covered in blood; he was no longer able to scream.

Qin Xian glanced at him coldly, picked up a vase beside him, and continued smashing it against him. The vase shattered with a crash. He chose the sharpest piece and raised it high, ready to stab Mr. Zhao in the neck.

"No! Qin Xian! You can't really kill him!!" A hurried voice rang out.

Qin Xian turned his head and saw that the bespectacled colleague who had been sitting next to him had left his seat and was standing trembling beside him.

Seeing him stop, the bespectacled colleague continued urgently, "Murder is illegal! You might go to jail for it, it's not worth it!"

Qin Xian glanced at him coldly, then turned back and continued to stab with the shard. The shard pierced President Zhao's neck, leaving a deep wound that exposed bone.

"Ah!! Murder!" "

A colleague's scream rang out, but Qin Xian, who had just committed murder, nonchalantly stood up, casually tossing aside the blood-stained shards, and walked towards the others.

His maniacal aura terrified his colleagues, who rushed to the door, frantically trying to escape.

"Ahhh! Don't kill me! Don't kill me!"

"Help! Someone's dead! Open the door, you outside!"

"Hey," Qin Xian called out speechlessly, but no one paid him any attention.

He sighed and slammed the ashtray on the table onto the floor. With a loud thud, his colleagues jolted and looked over, trembling and huddling together.

Looking at his colleagues, who were terrified like quails, Qin Xian coldly pointed behind him and said, "You can see for yourselves whether that thing is even human." "

A bolder colleague peeked over and saw that General Manager Zhao's body lay swollen on the floor, his skin covered in lividity and emitting a foul stench. Maggots were even oozing from the freshly cut wound on his neck; he didn't look like he had just died.

The stench assaulted everyone's eyes and noses, and for a moment, the entire office echoed with vomiting sounds.

Qin Xian silently took a step back, watching the world around him slowly blur, as if it were disappearing.

Was this... a dungeon cleared?

After a moment of disorientation, Qin Xian opened his eyes and found himself still sitting at his desk, the time on the wall already showing 6:00 PM.

He looked around; the other colleagues..." He regained his senses, but his expression was one of shock and confusion, clearly having no memory of what had just happened.

What happened? Was this reality or a dungeon?

Qin Xuan frowned, sensing his surroundings, but that monster from before seemed to be the true source of the strange feeling.

Given his skill level, he should only be encountering high-difficulty dungeons. But the strange creature he had just encountered was practically beginner-level; an ordinary person could easily kill it with a few blows…

Could it be some kind of trap?

Pre-order: "Save! My Beautiful and Powerful Teammate is Actually a Game Boss! [Full]" [Breakfast]

Synopsis: In 2045, a truly holographic game developed by China was launched with a bang.

It boasts an almost indistinguishable immersive experience from reality, magnificent and breathtaking scenery, an extremely realistic cultivation experience, and even NPCs that are indistinguishable from humans.

Jiang Zhige opened his eyes and looked down at the illusory yet real world beneath his feet. He knew clearly that he had once been a cultivator who had traversed the void. But now, he was the hidden final boss in this game.

Once, cultivators were forbidden from entering the mortal world. But now, in this interesting world, why not play a game with these mortals called "players"?

————
Mu Hucheng was among the first players to enter the game. He started exploring and leveling up, searching for teammates.

While fighting monsters of higher levels, he encountered a beautiful and powerful player, also dressed in beginner gear, staring intently at his tiger ears.

Mu Hucheng immediately smiled and said, "How about it? Want to touch them? Add me as a friend?"

The beautiful cultivator smiled and accepted the request, joining the team to conquer various dungeons together.

However, during one dungeon run, the settlement screen failed to appear.

Just as Mu Hucheng was about to contact the GM, he saw his beautiful teammate slowly walk towards a high position, her terrifying aura suppressing the entire area. Jiang Zhige drew his sword, pointed at them, and smiled slightly: "Because, only by defeating me can this dungeon be considered cleared." "

Thunder or Moe:

1. The protagonist (uke) is the strongest; no one can restrain or threaten him from beginning to end, including in the "game world" and the human world. The seme (uke) is also a top expert in the game. Super super super protagonist!

2. The seme's game character is a demon, a tiger, with round tiger ears, and can transform into beast form! This is the author's favorite trope; most of the author's works are like this!
