Chapter 2 If the boss dies, I won't have to work this lousy job anymore…

“What happened? I think I just fell asleep and had a really scary dream.”

“Me too! But I don’t remember the specifics, oh my god, I was covered in cold sweat.”

“Me too! This is so bizarre! Is there some kind of toxic gas in the office?”

“We haven’t opened the windows for ventilation in a long time, all the windows are closed, and the central air conditioning is off. My goodness, we just had a brush with death! Quick, open the windows!”

The office was in chaos. Some people immediately opened the windows for ventilation, while others continued to discuss the incident. Most people thought the problem was with the air, and no one suspected anything supernatural.

Qin Xuan closed his eyes, carefully sensing the surrounding atmosphere. Everything seemed normal; he detected nothing.

Either this was the real world, but the real world was different from what he imagined. Or, this was an unusual instance, one that even he couldn't detect anything amiss in his current state.

"Everyone, assemble in the meeting room within three minutes!"

"Everyone, assemble in the meeting room within three minutes!"

"Everyone, everyone, three...buzz...three minutes..."

The sudden loud announcement startled everyone.

"Is the loudspeaker broken?"

"Why is it a meeting so close to the end of the workday again..."

"I'm speechless, you idiot..."

Qin Xuan's face turned grim.

What's going on? Is this a looping instance? Or was what happened before a dream, and this is reality?

He rose with a grim face and walked towards the meeting room first. As he passed by, a colleague instinctively shivered, as if encountering something terrifying, and immediately made way for him.

Pushing open the meeting room door, a stench assaulted his nostrils. President Zhao's body lay on the floor, already decomposing; it was unclear how long he had been dead.

"Ah!! Someone's dead!! President Zhao is dead!!!"

Drawn by the smell, colleagues screamed at the horrific scene before them, and the office erupted in chaos. Qin Xian took a few steps back and pulled out his phone to call the police.

After two beeps, someone actually answered. The person on the other end spoke clearly, asked Qin Xian a few questions, and then solemnly stated that they would send someone immediately and asked Qin Xian to secure the scene.

Seeing his colleague raise his phone to call the police, he calmly said, "I've already called the police. Everyone, get out of here. The police will be here soon."

His colleagues looked at him. Most of them didn't recognize Qin Xuan, but his words seemed to possess a magical power, an instinctive force of fear and obedience.

Back in the office, no one was typing anymore. Most were gathered in small groups, intensely discussing the death scene they had just witnessed. Some were frantically typing on their phones, likely sharing the shocking event with friends, family, or online acquaintances.

Compared to before, everyone in the office now had vivid, lifelike expressions.

Qin Xuan opened the window and looked down. Sanitation workers were watering the flower beds, a young couple was sharing a milk tea by the roadside, and a delivery driver nimbly weaved through pedestrians on his electric scooter.

It felt so real, a realism he hadn't seen in two years; it didn't feel like he was in a game instance at all.

"Hey, who's he? Do we have anyone this handsome in the office?"

"It's Qin Xian, it's written on his name tag."

"I think I vaguely remember him, but I don't think he's ever talked much… He's so good-looking? And he seems to have a lot of charisma."

"Sister Li, why don't you add him on WeChat later?"

"...No, no, I don't know why, but I feel a little scared when I see him…"

"You know what, you really don't know, I'm also inexplicably afraid of him."

Qin Xian turned to look at them, and his previously chattering colleagues immediately turned away to change the subject.

"Hey, the boss is dead, do we still have to come to work tomorrow…"

Most likely, he won't have to go to this lousy job, Qin Xian thought listlessly.

A dozen minutes later, a team of police officers came upstairs and set up a cordon outside the meeting room. Two police officers entered the office to question who discovered the scene and when they last saw Boss Zhao.

After the discovery of Boss Zhao's body, everything that followed seemed normal.

Qin Xuan looked out the window again. He still preferred this to be the real world; after all, in the endless stream of instances, there was usually no option to call the police, and most of the time the police didn't come to handle cases.

He approached the policeman and tentatively said, "Officer, something strange happened. Just now, everyone in our office fell asleep, and we all had a nightmare."

The policeman suddenly looked up and asked, "Everyone was asleep? What kind of nightmare did you have?"

"Yes, yes, we were definitely asleep, maybe for ten or so minutes."

"I don't remember the specifics of the nightmare. What about you guys?"

Qin Xuan: "I remember something. I dreamt that Boss Zhao called us to a meeting, but he turned into a fat monster and tried to kill us."

His reminder made the others suddenly recall something.

“I think I also dreamt that President Zhao turned into a monster! But then it seemed like someone…”

Qin Xuan: “Officer, could this be caused by some kind of hallucinogenic gas?”

A policewoman across from him subconsciously said, “Probably not…”

But her colleague immediately interjected, “It’s possible. We’ll come back and check the air quality here to see if anyone poisoned it. Thank you for your cooperation. Please provide your names and phone numbers so we can investigate further.”

Qin Xuan observed the two officers’ reactions. Clearly, they had some suspicions about the cause of this strange mass sleeping incident. Initially, the police seemed to be treating this case as a routine death, but after he mentioned the strange events in the office, a look of sudden realization appeared in their eyes.

These police officers likely know that there are beings in this world that defy common sense.

Could it be that strange things already exist in the real world? Or have he simply never encountered them before?

Qin Xian descended the stairs with a grave expression. To verify the reality of this world, he hailed a taxi and had it drive from the east side of the city to the west, then circle around the outer ring road.

With the taxi driver's farewell, Qin Xian coldly scanned the fare and paid. The fare was 350 yuan, leaving him with over 6,700 yuan in his bank account.

Now, Qin Xian could roughly confirm that he was back in reality. So far, he had never seen a game instance that could simulate a massive, complex, and realistic city, where every small detail, every person's behavior, even the ants crawling through the flowerbeds were perfectly normal, without any logical errors.

These so-called game instances were actually just bizarre and unique realms. Some were as small as a single building, while others were as large as a small town or half a city.

It was completely dark. After eating a bowl of beef noodles nearby, Qin Xuan slowly walked home along the street.

Although he was more likely in the real world, the situation had become even more surreal. The real world also had its strangeness—was it a recent phenomenon, or had it always been there?

The streetlight ahead flickered suddenly. Qin Xian abruptly stopped, frowning and staring warily ahead.

A passerby gave him a strange look, then chuckled and walked past under the streetlight.

The light flickered twice more, and mosquitoes could be seen fluttering in the flashing light. Nothing else seemed amiss, just a slight short circuit.

Qin Xian frowned in annoyance and continued walking.

He lived in an old urban area. The roads were newly paved, but much of the infrastructure and housing was very old.

The buildings here didn't have elevators. They were all six stories high, and many windows were old-fashioned casement windows with ugly security grilles on the outside.

Qin Xian stopped in front of a building, looking at this familiar place.

This was where he grew up. He used to have a warm family; his parents ran a small noodle shop nearby. But after he went to university, they both passed away, and now he lived alone.

"Heh," Qin Xian chuckled.

Why was he constantly reminiscing about the past today? He felt rather melancholic.

He lifted his foot to go upstairs when he suddenly heard a soft whimpering sound coming from the alleyway beside him. The alleyway wasn't illuminated; it was completely dark there. Was it a small animal or something eerie?

Qin Xian turned and walked into the alley. In the dim light, he saw a curled-up dark shape.

Upon closer inspection, it was a black dog. There was some blood on its body, the fur on its paws was matted with congealed blood, and there was a deep, bone-revealing laceration on its thigh.

He was being paranoid... He knelt on one knee, carefully observing the poor animal.

The dog lifted its eyelids to glance at him, then immediately closed them again.

It seemed indifferent and wary, but perhaps it was simply too weak.

"You're quite pitiful, but I can't take you in. Although I really want a dog, I can barely afford to feed myself right now."

After all, he would be unemployed starting tomorrow.

The dog lifted its eyelids again, letting out another soft whimper.

Qin Xian showed no expression upon hearing this, stood up, turned, and left, ignoring the increasingly pitiful whimpers behind him.

The black dog fell silent, its eyes fixed on the direction Qin Xian had left, a flicker of bloodlust in its pupils. Wisps of black mist condensed beneath it, forming a darkness even darker than shadows. The black dog slowly sank into this darkness, but before it could completely disappear, its ears twitched, and it immediately returned to its original, weak state, lying down on the spot.

Qin Xian reappeared at the alley entrance, this time holding a disposable cup. He squatted down and poured the water from the cup directly into the black dog's mouth.

The dog's clear black and white eyes looked at him, and it opened its mouth to gulp down the water. After feeding it most of the water, Qin Xian put the cup aside, stood up, and said, "Alright, if you can drink water, you should be fine. There are many kind people around here. Keep howling for a while, and someone should be able to take you home."

With that, he left completely without looking back. Back home, he collapsed wearily onto the sofa, closing his eyes and drifting into a half-asleep, half-awake state.

But only twenty minutes later, his eyelashes trembled uneasily, and he opened his eyes, his gaze clear and unwavering. This was a consequence of spending so much time in the infinite flow world—an inability to enjoy a restful sleep.

Qin Xian was already used to it, so he simply took out his phone and started searching for discussions about paranormal events. He browsed through all sorts of bizarre rumors, finding nothing particularly noteworthy.

However, after searching the news, he discovered some strange things.

The first news item was about a school suicide that shocked the nation, sparking online discussions and trending on several hot search topics. Amidst discussions about academic pressure and school bullying, several comments caught Qin Xian's attention.

[Netizen 1: My classmate is from this school. He said the school is haunted. When he was walking home after evening self-study, he saw a ghostly hand leading a top student up the stairs and then pushing him off the roof.]

The ghostly hand mentioned in this comment resembles a weak and eerie entity commonly found in limitless fantasy worlds.

He clicked on the replies to this comment; several people from the same province with the same IP address were agreeing.

The second news item that caught Qin Xian's attention was a bus fire.

Although the police said the cause of the fire was under investigation, a considerable number of people said they saw the entire bus suddenly engulfed in flames.

The photos of the bus wreckage didn't show any signs of a major explosion; the sudden engulfment in flames defied normal natural laws.

Then came the gas explosion in the new residential area, the serial killer in the city, and multiple missing persons.

These news reports all came from the last two months, and many netizens lamented the increased number of major accidents recently. Could something be wrong with the real world?

Qin Xian put away his phone, closed his eyes, and activated the abilities he had gained in that world, as if he were in a dungeon. He had tried it when he returned to the real world; nothing had changed, and he seemed to have completely reverted to being an ordinary person.

But just now, he had a subtle feeling.

Qin Xian's closed eyes suddenly snapped open, his irises turning a brilliant gold.

This was one of the skills he acquired in the Infinite Flow world, called "Insight." It allowed him to see the true nature of things and detect the polluted aura emanating from strange entities, thus pinpointing their location. Furthermore, this ability could only conceal, not deceive; if something could be seen, it was undeniably real.

It sounded incredibly useful, but in reality, it could only be used once a day, for just a few seconds. Exceeding this limit would severely strain his eyes, potentially leading to blindness.

The world before him remained unchanged, which, according to the "Insight" ability, largely proved that this world was not an illusion.

His eyes began to sting. Qin Xuan forced himself to walk to the window and gaze into the distance, still finding nothing.

The pain became unbearable, forcing him to close his eyes. When he opened his eyes again, the light had returned to its deep brown hue.

Qin Xian stood by the bed, frowning in thought.

His skills had reactivated, but his other abilities hadn't fully returned. For now, only his Insight skill was usable.

And the Insight skill confirmed to him that this was indeed the real world.

That was truly bizarre. Had he not glimpsed the real world for over twenty years? Or, there was an even more terrifying possibility.

Qin Xian thought with a dark expression: the sinister and treacherous God might not be so kind as to send him back so easily. Could it be that he brought something unclean with him when he returned?

Qin Xian gripped the windowsill tightly, his fingertips turning white from the force.

He didn't want to become a sinner who brought about the world's end.

"Waaah..."

The familiar whimpering sound came again from downstairs. Qin Xian looked down; the stray dog was still curled up in the same spot, unclaimed, its whimpers much weaker than before.

Qin Xian frowned, looking down.

He didn't know what the dog had been through, whether it had been abused. But he knew that pets that had been abused and died tragically were most likely to attract the supernatural or become supernatural themselves. This could potentially lead to other casualties, and he should intervene.

He immediately turned around, searched the wardrobe, and found a clean bath towel before going downstairs.

The black dog in the alley was still lying in the same spot, its tail pressed against the ground, motionless, perhaps because it was too weak and frightened. Even upon seeing Qin Xian again, the dog merely opened its eyes coldly and stared at him silently.

Qin Xian crouched down and carefully covered the dog with a towel.

Seemingly aware that the human was rescuing it, the stray dog didn't move, obediently being wrapped and picked up.

The smell of blood mixed with the dog's own odor and other foul smells assaulted his nostrils. Qin Xian gave a slight look of disgust: "Tsk, you're really dirty. It's a pity I can't give you a bath right now."

The dog remained silent, offering no response. But don't expect a dog to understand human speech or give a reply.

Qin Xian carried it upstairs and placed it on the balcony.

There was no other way; the smell was too strong. Anyway, it was springtime, the weather was neither too hot nor too cold, so leaving it on the balcony wouldn't be a big problem.

Then, he rummaged through the first-aid kit, found some near-expiration disinfectant and bandages, and skillfully cleaned, disinfected, and bandaged the dog's wounds.

"It's alright, just a slightly fractured leg. A few open wounds too. You probably don't need to go to the vet; I can't afford it anyway. If you're still alive tomorrow, I'll take care of you temporarily." Qin Xian patted the dog's head, turned, went back into the room, and closed the balcony door.
