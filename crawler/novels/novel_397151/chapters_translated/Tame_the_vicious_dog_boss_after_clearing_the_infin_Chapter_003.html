Chapter 3 Who's hitting someone with a bone?

The city lights blazed brightly at night, even the sky was tinged with a hazy glow—pure light pollution.

But darkness never truly receded, still lingering in every corner of the city. For example, the alley where the dog was found was completely dark unless the residents turned on their lights.

Perhaps it was because it was so dark that no one had rescued the dog.

Qin Xian stood by the window, looking down for a while, then grabbed his coat, put it on, and prepared to go out.

He had too many questions in his mind, but staying home and racking his brains wouldn't yield any results; he might as well go for a walk.

It was the dead of night, the time when demons and monsters roamed.

"Awooo..."

The dog's barking interrupted Qin Xian's attempt to open the door. It seemed to be trying to assert its presence, reminding its owner that there was another living creature in the house.

An ordinary person might have immediately gone over to comfort and pet it. But Qin Xian's heart wasn't much softer than wood. After glancing at the balcony to make sure the dog was alright, he closed the door and left.

Downstairs, the residents' fitness area was blasting thumping music from the square. As soon as Qin Xian went downstairs, he headed in the opposite direction of the sound.

It wasn't just Qin Xian who disliked noisy environments. These retired people, with companions and the mood and energy to dance, weren't exactly welcomed by the Eerie.

The Eerie feeds on negative human emotions; the more negative emotions, the more easily they attract them. For example, hospitals, office buildings, some schools, etc.

Qin Xian opened a map app to search for the nearest hospital and then slowly wandered in that direction.

He didn't actually want to deal with the supernatural anymore; his dream was to return to the normal world and live a peaceful life. But right now, doubt and unease compelled him to take action.

Unfortunately, this hospital was neither famous nor had many patients. Taking advantage of a security guard yawning, Qin Xian slipped inside. After circling around for a while, he didn't see anything unusual. Even the inpatient ward had only a handful of people, and the doctors on duty were all asleep at their desks.

Everything was normal.

"Tsk." Qin Xian walked out, annoyed. As he was about to leave, he noticed a nearby market. On one of the meat stalls were two huge, unsold beef bones. Next to them, fresh beef for tomorrow was being butchered; the fresh muscle twitched like worms as the sharp knife cut into it.

Residual blood spread across the ground, adding more filth to the already black, greasy surface.

Every day, several animals were butchered and chopped here… the meat scraps and blood flowed onto the ground, washed away by water, but some remnants still clung to the surface.

Day after day, customers' shoes developed a disgustingly sticky feeling when they walked on it.

"Hey handsome, are you buying meat?"

Qin Xuan snapped out of his daze, clenching his slightly numb hand to confirm that what he was seeing was just an ordinary farmers' market.

"If you're not buying, please stand back a bit. We have work to do," the butcher grumbled impatiently.

Qin Xuan glanced at the stall. There was still some meat left on the two pork bones, but they didn't look very fresh.

A dog would probably love this… He could take it home, wash it, and roast it on the gas stove; that would keep the dog eating for a long time.

He told the vendor, "I want these two bones."

"You want this?" the vendor asked suspiciously. "Don't you want some fresh beef? Freshly slaughtered, it's rare."

Qin Xuan remained expressionless. He probably didn't have enough cash to buy the meat.

A few minutes later, Qin Xian bought two large bones from a vendor at a low price.

After his trip, he had finally made some gains. He planned to walk around a bit more and find a pet store to buy some affordable dog food.

But he hadn't gone far when he heard the wailing of police sirens in the distance. A black Santana and two police cars with sirens blaring were staging a scene straight out of a movie. The Santana was frantically trying to shake off its pursuers, even veering off the road and onto the sidewalk, smashing a fire hydrant and sending a jet of water flying.

Only Qin Xian was standing on the sidewalk; the Santana completely ignored him and charged straight at him. A frantic shout came from the police car behind: "Get out of the way! Get out of the way!!"

As danger drew ever closer, Qin Xuan didn't run or dodge. Instead, he pulled out a beef bone, spun around on his right foot, and hurled it with tremendous force.

The beef bone shot out in a flash of white light, the Santana's window shattering, and the car veered out of control into a flowerbed, crashing into a utility pole with a thud.

The police car behind slammed on its brakes, and several officers rushed out, guns drawn, approaching the Santana.

"Don't move! Police!"

"Stop resisting immediately, get down! Or we'll shoot!!"

Qin Xuan, watching from afar, frowned. A man in black suddenly darted out of the car, breaking through the police's encirclement at incredible speed.

"Stop! Don't move! Or we'll shoot!!"

The police gave chase, and seeing no one around, quickly fired two shots at the man. But the figure didn't stop, clearly missing.

Qin Xuan, on the other side, saw everything clearly. It wasn't that the police were bad shooters; rather, this man had dodged both bullets with superhuman reflexes.

"Hahahaha! Trash!" the man in black laughed, turning his head and provocatively raising his middle finger at the police.

But the moment he turned around, his heart skipped a beat. Someone had appeared in front of him, brandishing a massive bone and swinging it violently.

The speed, the distance!!!

"Thump!!!" A flash of white light went through the man's vision, and then he knew nothing more.

The police officer who had been chasing him slowed his pace, staring in astonishment at the good Samaritan. This guy had actually knocked the suspect unconscious with a bone?!

Looking down, he saw the poor man in black lying on the ground, eyes half-open, all his front teeth gone, blood gushing from his collapsed nose—a truly pitiful sight.

"Uh…" The officer holstered his pistol, momentarily speechless.

"You're welcome." Qin Xian replied first, his voice as calm as if he was just passing by to help someone pick something up.

He stuffed the stick bone into a plastic bag and twirled his fingers.

Grease sticks to your hands and makes them sticky and disgusting.

If I had known better, I should have wrapped the bones in a plastic bag and carried them.

"What did he do?" Qin Xian tried hard to ignore the nausea and raised his chin towards the man in black.

His half-long hair was gathered up casually with a hair rope and placed on one shoulder. Because the movement was relatively large just now, it is now half untied.

Under the bright red and blue lights of the police car, her face looked very beautiful and delicate, and she didn't look like a ruthless person who could hit people with a stick on the street until their faces were broken.

Faced with this man, the policeman was actually a little intimidated. He stammered, "Um, this guy just robbed a shopping mall."

"Just a regular robbery?" Qin Xian emphasized.

"Huh? Regular? Robberies of shopping malls aren't common these days, are they? And to dare speed through the streets afterward?" The policeman was somewhat confused.

"Anyway, sir, thank you for your bravery!"

"You're welcome. May I go over there to find my other bone?" Qin Xian casually pointed to the pitiful Santana with its hood sticking up not far away.

"Huh...huh? What bone?"

The policeman followed Qin Xian to the car, where he stepped onto the wrecked vehicle and rummaged through the wreckage, pulling out another beef bone.

Policeman: ???

So, crashing the car into the utility pole was this guy's doing too?!

Qin Xian looked at the bone: "Ah, you can't eat it."

It was riddled with shards of broken glass; feeding it to a dog would be killing it.

He turned and held the bone up to the police officer, asking, "Do you need this? As evidence?"

"Ah...ah? No, uh, but you can put it back..."

Qin Xuan unhesitatingly tossed the bone back into the car, turned to the officer, and said, "Can I ask you a question?"

The officer instinctively nodded obediently, "Go ahead."

Qin Xuan asked, "Has anything strange happened recently? Like anything supernatural?"

This question clearly touched on some confidential information, and the officer immediately replied, "Comrade, don't believe rumors online."

Qin Xuan pressed further: "Like..." "Did a CEO die in the Cuiyang Building this afternoon?"

The policeman's expression turned serious: "How did you know?"

"Oh, I work there, of course I know. The whole building was in an uproar."

This answer eased the policeman's tension slightly, but he still maintained a stern face and lectured in a serious tone: "If you're really concerned about this, just wait for our police report. Don't believe or spread rumors now, and don't be so curious. By the way, could you please provide your ID number and phone number?"

"Oh," Qin Xian replied coldly, then searched his memory for a long time before finally reciting his ID number.

It seemed that directly asking the police wouldn't yield any information. But the breakthrough was indeed with the police; they had come across some paranormal events.

He could deduce it from the subtle expression on the police officer's face.

So, should he arrest a police officer and question him?

No, assaulting a police officer is illegal.

Qin Xian looked in the direction of the man in black. The police had already taken him away, probably rushing him to the hospital to treat his injuries.

This man would probably be detained in the hospital for now, which was the best opportunity to get close to him and find out the truth. It would be troublesome to find him once he was sent to a detention center.

Then it would be best to follow him to the hospital now, but…

He looked down at the bone in his hand, remembering the dog he had just found at home.

Sigh, if he had known it would be this troublesome, he shouldn't have gotten a pet. He couldn't even go out in peace.

But the dog didn't seem to be in a hurry to be fed, and its wound had been treated; he probably didn't need to rush back.

After weighing his options for a few seconds, he picked up the bone, hailed a taxi, and headed to the hospital.

---------------------------

About ten minutes later, at the entrance of the Municipal People's Hospital, Qin Xuan, carrying a bone, surveyed the towering hospital building.

As expected of one of the city's top-tier hospitals, it was more than three times the size of the small hospital he'd visited during his walks. Even late at night, people were still coming and going. The large red characters for "Emergency Room" emitted an ominous red glow in the night, and the ambulance doors at the entrance were open; someone had just been brought in.

He closed his eyes and sensed the surroundings; unfortunately, there was nothing unusual.

Qin Xian asked for a disposable mask at the hospital guardhouse, put it on, and headed straight for the emergency room.

Quite by chance, as soon as he entered, he saw the person whose face was covered in blood from being hit by his own bone placed on a trolley, and a doctor was cleaning and disinfecting his wounds with medication.

The doctor cleaning the wound was talking to a police officer:

"Wow, that was brutal! A contusion to the nasal cartilage, and several front teeth knocked out. What did you use to hit him?"

"...Uh, a cow leg bone."

"What??? This...this is a fight that happened in the market?"

Qin Xian listened to the conversation without changing his expression, sat down in the nearest chair, and waited until the person finished their examination before following them into the inpatient building.

The police handcuffed the man to the metal railing of the hospital bed and stood guard at the door of the ward, waiting for the person inside to slowly wake up.

Seeing that the police showed no sign of leaving, Qin Xian turned and walked away.

Not in a hurry to find someone to ask questions, he sensed an eerie atmosphere after entering the building.

Unfortunately, after wandering through several floors, Qin Xian didn't actually trigger anything strange. Until he returned…
