Chapter 5 Even Living with a Dog Is More Comfortable

After knocking the man unconscious, Qin Xian felt a pang of regret. He should have at least let Xun Dawei come downstairs with him.

Now, to prevent the man from being killed by the monsters after losing his ability to resist, he had to throw him outside the hospital.

With no other option, he found a rope, put it in his pocket, and then, under the silent watchful eyes of the Black Membrane Monsters, removed the bed railing.

Then, Qin Xian ripped the man off the bed like tearing a sack of potatoes, dragging him away from the ward under the watchful eyes of the Black Membrane Monsters.

Fortunately, there was an elevator right next to the ward. After going down to the first floor, Qin Xian immediately tied the person hand and foot to a pillar at the hospital entrance, deliberately placing them at an angle where they wouldn't be easily noticed.

This was to prevent the person from suddenly appearing and frightening people when the domain dissipated.

They were still in the eerie domain. Outside the inpatient building entrance, it was pitch black; there wasn't a single living person in sight.

It looked quite terrifying, but there was no sense of danger in this area.

The most dangerous place was probably where the domain's master was located, around the fourth floor.

Qin Xian cautiously ascended the stairs and, on the third floor, followed the sound of weeping to find a haggard-looking woman.

She looked to be in her early thirties, huddled behind the emergency exit door, trembling. Qin Xuan carefully confirmed she was alive before greeting her, "Hello."

The woman jumped in fright, nervously wiping away her tears to assess the situation.

A young man appeared at the end of the stairs, slowly walking towards her. He was handsome, but appeared somewhat aloof, and was holding a bone in his hand.

A bone?

The woman asked in confusion, "You... hello, are you human?"

"I am," Qin Xian replied. "What's your name? What happened?"

The woman answered softly, "My name is An Baixin. I don't know what happened to me... was it a ghost? Do ghosts really exist?"

"What kind of ghost?"

"My father-in-law turned into a monster, and then, and then my husband... and his brother's family all grew black things. And the people in the next ward too! It's so scary, what's going on? Do ghosts really exist?" An Baixin hugged herself in panic, trembling even more violently.

She was wearing a very cheap T-shirt and jeans, her long hair, which was tied up at the back of her head, was now mostly loose, hanging messily beside her pale, malnourished face.

An Baixin continued, "I want to run, but I can't get out. Are you here to save me? Please, please save me!"

Qin Xian replied, "Then we need to go check on your family first."

"No, no, no!" An Baixin shook her head, "I don't want to go back, I'll die!"

"So you're staying here alone? But I have to tell you, nothing is coming out to kill you now because they haven't developed yet. It will be different in a while. If you continue to stay here alone, you'll most likely get into trouble." Qin Xian finished speaking, opened the emergency exit, and slowly walked inside, showing no compassion whatsoever.

A moment later, stumbling footsteps followed.

An Baixin's legs went weak, but she still decided to trust the young man before her.

But soon, she began to regret it.

Just as they returned to the ward corridor from the emergency exit, the two bumped into a black monster dressed in a hospital gown.

Various layers of black, fleshy tissue covered and piled up on its body, but its shape still retained a human form.

Its clothing made a terrifying association.

This thing must be a human in disguise.

An Baixin screamed, instinctively covering her head.

Qin Xian, standing beside her, shoved her aside, using his bone to block the monster's claws.

"Hiccup! Hiccup!" the monster howled, trying to push the bone aside and continue its attack.

"Crack!"

Qin Xian swiftly moved behind it and snapped its neck.

An Baixin stared in disbelief at the corpse on the ground: "It, it..."

"He'd been dead for a long time, looking like this," Qin Xian said, walking around the body and continuing forward.

An Baixin quickly followed, muttering weakly, "You...you gave him a quick death...that's good."

This realm didn't seem to have dragged too many people in; only a handful of victims roamed the corridor. There was even one that hadn't fully developed, only knowing how to dazedly make "ee-ee" sounds at the wall.

Qin Xian ignored it, casually dealing with a few monsters before hearing several people arguing in the distance.

In this gloomy, deathly place, people were actually arguing regardless of the danger.

"That...that looks like my husband," An Baixin whispered.

Qin Xuan pushed open the door and entered.

He saw something lying on the bed in the ward, with three people standing beside it. Each of them had undergone a strange transformation; black tumors were climbing up their limbs, covering their necks and growing onto their faces.

The one on the bed was no longer human; it was just a mass of black, rotting flesh.

But the three people beside the bed seemed oblivious to these horrific sights, continuing their heated argument.

To the right of the bed was a middle-aged man, presumably An Baixin's husband.

To the left stood another middle-aged couple, An Baixin's brother-in-law and his wife.

An Baixin's husband said to the monster on the bed, "Why should I only get half of the inheritance! I desperately need money, Dad, don't you know that?"

The monster lying on the bed, addressed as "Dad," didn't speak, only emitting strange laughter.

The younger uncle spoke up, "I'm Dad's most favored son! I've always been better than you, admit it! The money should be mine, not a penny to you!"

His wife chimed in, "That's right! You gambled away all your wife's money and now you're asking Dad for more? Have you no shame?!"

Qin Xian turned to look at An Baixin.

An Baixin immediately lowered her head, a flash of anger in her eyes, but she still gripped the hem of her clothes tightly and remained silent.

"Bullshit! I'm talking about the inheritance! How many times have you come by while Dad's been sick?! How much money have you spent? It's all been me taking care of him!"

"Taking care of him? You haven't been to the hospital much either. It's all An Baixin taking care of him."

"As a daughter-in-law, she should take care of both sets of parents. I have to work. Besides, my wife has helped with the care, isn't that also part of our responsibility?"

The three of them started arguing and wrestling, the black tumor secreting a sticky fluid that almost completely enveloped them.

But they didn't care at all; only the word "inheritance" occupied their minds.

Qin Xian leaned against the wall, watching the drama with great interest.

It's a pity there weren't any sunflower seeds for sale here, otherwise he would have at least had some.

Finally, An Baixin's husband reached out to his "father" on the bed, yelling, "Dad! You can't be so biased! Tell me your bank card PIN! And where are all the family collectibles?!"

As his hand gripped his "father's" neck, the tumor on his hand began to merge with the monster on the bed, and within moments, his entire arm had melted into it.

Faced with this situation, he didn't struggle at all, and continued to persuade his father to leave his inheritance to him.

An Baixin's husband's mouth, which was opening and closing as he muttered about money, was pulled close to his "father's" cheek, looking like a kiss.

Qin Xuan clicked his tongue twice; this scene was both bizarre and fascinating.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the bed, the younger brother and his wife weren't to be outdone. They grabbed their "father's" arm and shouted, "Dad, you love me the most! Your things must be for me, right? Tell me the password! Don't give it to my brother, he'll squander it all!"

"Yes, Dad! We haven't been able to visit you much because we've been too busy. And your sister-in-law takes care of you; she's so considerate. We wouldn't be of much help to her anyway!"

The group chattered on, slowly blending together.

Qin Xian glanced down at An Baixin, who was biting her lip and hugging him, and casually handed her something.

An Baixin looked at it and saw it was a sharp scalpel. She didn't know when this man had gotten his hands on it.

"Give it to me?" she asked in surprise.

Qin Xian shoved the scalpel directly into her hand, pointing to the "father" on the bed, saying, "This should be the biggest boss. He's not too difficult to deal with. I don't need this knife, but you can use it for self-defense."

"Thank you..." An Baixin, holding the scalpel, stepped back, giving Qin Xian space, while she tried to shrink into a corner.

As she stepped back, the "father," who had remained motionless on the bed, suddenly raised his hand shakily, uttering a hoarse old man's voice: "An Baixin, An Baixin, my urine bag is full, come here and empty it! Also, my legs need wiping, come here quickly!"

An Baixin took two steps back in fear, unable to hold back her cries: "No! I don't want to take care of you!"

"You are my daughter-in-law! You must take care of me!"

"Then why don't you want your son to take care of you?! Why don't you want your other daughter-in-law to take care of you! You boss me around and make things difficult for me, why aren't you dead yet! Just die already!!" An Baixin clutched her head, black growths beginning to sprout from her fingers.

Enraged by her words, the monster on the bed finally moved. Its mouth split open, and a long, springy, blackish-red tongue shot out, coiling directly at An Baixin.

With a "smack," Qin Xian knocked the tongue to the ground with a bone.

"I can deal with this thing much faster, but there's something I need to make clear to you. This field is closely related to you. If you can't fight back and change your mindset, you'll be tormented by nightmares for the rest of your life, and you'll die within a year." Qin Xian swung his arms twice, swatting the tongue back as it lunged at him again.

"Change...mindset?" An Baixin repeated the word, looking at Qin Xian with a confused expression.

Qin Xian met her gaze for a moment, then turned away, ignoring her completely, showing no intention of continuing to act as a life coach.

"An Baixin, An Baixin... I want honey water! An Baixin, why aren't you here yet! An Baixin!!"

"An Baixin, didn't you hear what Dad said?! Take good care of him and the inheritance will be mine, hurry up and go over there!"

"An Baixin, help me wipe myself!"

Hearing the monster's roars on the bed, An Baixin finally couldn't take it anymore: "Get out! Let your son serve you! I don't want to endure it anymore! I don't want to keep waiting for you to die so I can be free." "Your whole family are weirdos! You're all crazy! I want a divorce, I want to leave your house, and of course, before I leave, I'll take everything that's mine!"

"You dare!!" The four mouths on the bed yelled simultaneously, "What kind of wife are you! If you dare leave, no one will want you!"

"Laughable, I'd rather live with a dog than with trash like you!" An Baixin gripped the scalpel tightly, aiming it at the tongue that was reaching for her and slashing down hard.

Qin Xian stepped aside slightly, giving her a slightly approving look.

Indeed, living with a dog would be more comfortable.
