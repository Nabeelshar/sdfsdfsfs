Chapter 7 To be my dog, you must follow the rules…

What bizarre creature's prototype is just an ordinary black dog?

Qin Xuan searched his memory.

During his time surviving in the Infinite Flow world, he encountered many animal-type monsters, but 95% of them were the lowest-level monsters in dungeons. They were simply ordinary animals mutated after being contaminated; they were only slightly more ferocious and fearless than normal animals. Small to medium-sized mutated animals could be wiped out by an adult with a few blows.

Of course, there were also the 5% of terrifying monsters, the most powerful of which happened to be canine.

Its name was Calamity Hound, its body wreathed in red and black flames, capable of devouring the luck of its enemies. Its enormous size allowed it to easily destroy a house, and it could also absorb the luck of its enemies, causing them continuous misfortune.

It was an extremely troublesome creature.

But the original form of that dog couldn't possibly be this small, and besides, he had already killed the Calamity Dog.

Perhaps this dog was just an ordinary infected animal from the real world?

Qin Xian raised his foot, approaching the black dog with his toe.

The black dog's long, pointed ears perked up warily, its head down scrutinizing Qin Xian's shoe, but it made no other move.

"Hey." Qin Xian lightly nudged the black dog's thigh with his toe.

The black dog finally moved, pulling its leg back under its belly. Its two pointed ears stood erect, facing Qin Xian, appearing quite alert.

Seeing this, Qin Xian bent down and held out his hand to the dog's black nose.

The black dog sniffed it, showing no fear or aggression. Qin Xian remembered some pet bloggers saying that this was the dog collecting human scent, and if it didn't attack or run away, he could try petting it.

So Qin Xian placed his hand directly on the dog's head and stroked it a couple of times.

The fur on its head was short and a bit rough, but it felt quite nice to the touch. Each time he stroked it, the pointed ears would fold to the sides, which looked rather amusing.

Okay, I can't see anything too serious. Releasing animals that might be contaminated could have adverse effects, so I'll keep it at home and observe it first.

Qin Xian thought, patted the dog's head, and turned to go back to his room to cook.

After a whole night of fussing, he was practically starving. He simply boiled two eggs and some glutinous rice balls he'd found in the fridge, just like before he experienced the infinite flow world, cobbling together a simple dinner.

He picked up his bowl, pulled out the only chair at the table, and was about to pick up his chopsticks when he suddenly saw the dog on the balcony twitch its nose, poke its way through the crack in the door, and limp over to him.

The dog's black eyes were fixed on the eggs and glutinous rice balls on the table.

Qin Xian remembered he hadn't touched the dog food: "You don't eat dog food, but you want my food?"

Back in his rural hometown, his grandmother had a yellow mongrel. The mongrel, naturally, never had the chance to eat dog food. When people ate, it would sit at their feet, watching their chopsticks expectantly.

Qin Xian picked up a peeled egg to put on the ground, but as soon as his hand approached the black dog, it suddenly reached out and snatched the hard-boiled egg from his hand.

Its red tongue licked his fingertip, feeling wet. He brought his hand up to his face; it was covered in glistening dog saliva.

Qin Xian frowned, got up, and washed his hands. When he returned, he saw the black dog had already finished the egg and was now staring at the other egg in his bowl.

Qin Xian returned to his seat, patted the dog's head, and pointed at its nose, saying, "If you want to stay in my house, you must follow the rules. You're not allowed to eat from my hand. Also, is your tail injured? I haven't seen you wag it at all. Hmm, suspicious."

He narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing it.

The black dog tilted its head, but its tail remained still. This was to be expected; after all, dogs don't understand human speech.

Qin Xian ignored it and slowly finished his bowl of glutinous rice balls. He then peeled the remaining egg, ate a few bites, and tossed it into the dog's mouth.

Watching the black dog swallow the egg in two gulps, he said, "It seems I should give you a name..."

The dog blinked, listening attentively.

Qin Xian glanced at the empty bowl and said, "Then I'll call you Tangyuan (Sweet Rice Ball)."

Tangyuan: "..."

Qin Xian inexplicably saw a hint of displeasure on the dog's face.

But what's wrong with the name? It's quite cute.

"Just be grateful I didn't eat 'Wowo Tou' (a type of steamed bun) earlier," Qin Xian patted the dog's head, then pointed to the balcony. "Now, go back to the balcony and sleep."

"Hmph." Tangyuan shook its head unhappily and let out a low growl.

Qin Xian expressionlessly raised his foot and nudged it against its leg. "Come on, to the balcony."

"Ugh!" Tangyuan whimpered again, limping a step back before stopping.

Qin Xian stood up, bent down, and tried to simply hug the dog.

Just as his hand lowered, Tangyuan suddenly barked, glaring fiercely at the person before him, its fangs peeking out from beneath its taut lips.

Qin Xian frowned, grabbing the dog's muzzle and forcibly retracting its exposed teeth. He sat on his chair, looking down at the dog, his eyes narrowing menacingly as he lowered his voice, slowly asking, "What? I saved you and you still want to bite me? Don't force me to slap you."

Tangyuan's growling weakened slightly, its eyes seeming to clear a little. After staring at Qin Xian for a few seconds, its tail, which had been drooping, flicked, it growled, and slowly turned and returned to the balcony.

On the balcony, Qin Xian had made a makeshift doghouse for it using old clothes. It climbed up, tail drooping, and lay down.

Raising a dog also involves training it. If its status isn't established from the beginning, it's likely to develop bad habits, or even become aggressive.

Qin Xian didn't want to pamper the dog like a son. For it to stay in this home, it first needed to understand its place.

Looking at it through the glass door, the dog was curled up in a ball on the pile of old clothes, its eyes closed.

So far, it was obedient, but too indifferent to people.

Looking up at the clock on the wall, the hands already pointed to three in the morning. Luckily, the boss was completely dead; he didn't have to go to work tomorrow.

Qin Xian changed into his pajamas, lay down on the bed, and played on his phone until almost five before turning off the light and going to sleep.

As his breathing gradually calmed, Tangyuan stood up on the balcony, pushed open the glass balcony door, and entered the living room.

Its steps were steady; its legs weren't lame at all.

Qin Xuan's room door wasn't completely closed, leaving a small crack.

Through the crack, one could see the person on the bed with shoulder-length black hair spread across the pillow. His skin, deprived of sunlight for a long time, was excessively pale; even in the darkness, his features and expression were discernible.

His thin lips were slightly pursed, and the downward curve of his eyes softened his otherwise stern appearance.

The canine breathing grew clearer, and if someone were looking out the window at that moment, they would be horrified to see a pair of blood-red beastly eyes burning in the darkness.

The uneasy atmosphere made Qin Xian frown, his breathing becoming uneven, and he abruptly opened his eyes.

But there was nothing outside the crack in the door, and everything was quiet; nothing unusual had happened.

The next day, Qin Xian didn't open his eyes until after ten o'clock, feeling uneasy. He hadn't slept well since entering the Infinite Flow world, and he had been startled awake again yesterday, leaving him somewhat annoyed.

Frustrated, he scratched his messy hair and simply leaned against the bed, playing on his phone.

Seeing the red "99" bubble in the upper right corner of his WeChat, he knew he was in for a surprise when he woke up.

The news exploded in the company WeChat group: everyone knew their boss had died in their own company, and in such a gruesome manner.

Scrolling through the messages, he even found unblurred pictures of the corpse posted in the group.

Qin Xuan even clicked on one of them, remaining calm despite the gruesome scene.

[A: Ahhh, that was terrifying! Take it back! Disrespecting the deceased is dangerous, or he might come after you tonight!]

[B: Hey, I heard he ate money and bank cards to death. How did that happen? Was he crazy? Why would he eat money?]

[C: It's true! He ate my wallet, and the police took it too.] "Even if you gave it back, I wouldn't want it anymore, it's covered in stuff..."

[A: I had nightmares all night yesterday, I was terrified, really, thank goodness.]

[D: I can't open the picture... My friend saw the corpse with his own eyes, and now he's having mental problems, he won't eat or drink.]

[E: Don't you guys think this is too weird? Things haven't been peaceful in the city lately, it feels like a lot of people have died, and I heard some people are missing.]

[B: I'm planning to go to the temple to pray today.]

Qin Xuan ignored the whole bunch of screaming and arguing, and picked out a few key pieces of information to look at.

Someone from the Infinite Flow world brought a "seed"? Calling it that probably means they need to choose a place to plant it and slowly cultivate it.

Could there be a seed hidden in City A? What does it look like? Where is it? How do I get rid of it?

Qin Xian pondered, then opened the job-seeking forum. His post actually had a reply.

[Anonymous 2684: OP, I really feel like I'm being haunted by a ghost lately. Seriously, there really are ghosts. But I don't know if you're a true expert or a fraud. I request an in-person meeting.]

Qin Xian replied: [Sure, meet me at McDonald's on Huiguang Road at 2 PM.]

[Anonymous 2684: Sure, see you this afternoon.]

Things have made a new progress, and Qin Xian's mood finally recovered from his terrible sleep. He got up, changed his clothes, and went out the door, only to bump into Tangyuan, who was peeking at him from the living room.

Qin Xian was stunned for a moment, then remembered that there was now a living creature in his house. He'd forgotten his dog there all morning and hadn't fed it. Wait, there should have been dog food on the balcony.

Qin Xian went to the balcony and checked; the bowl of dog food was indeed untouched.

It wasn't eating a single bite. Did he have to make dog food for it every day from now on? That wouldn't do.

He placed the dog food in front of Tang Yuan and commanded, "Eat up."

However, Tang Yuan remained unmoved, sitting there staring at Qin Xian.

Qin Xian, already in a bad mood, became even more serious upon seeing this: "Eat."

Tang Yuan turned its head away, refusing to eat.

"Tsk." Qin Xian put down the bowl, grabbed a handful of dog food, and with his other hand, forced a slit open the dog's mouth and shoved the food into its mouth.

Tangyuan growled softly, turning its head to spit out the food in its mouth. But before it could, its eyes darted upwards, and it saw Qin Xian's cold gaze and grim mood.

It obediently stretched its neck and swallowed the entire dog food.

"Not bad." Qin Xian's eyes immediately warmed, and he even smiled for a fleeting 0.1 seconds.

"As a reward, I'll cook you some eggs. Hmm? There's also a piece of chicken breast here..."

Qin Xian searched through the refrigerator, finally finding a hard piece of chicken breast in a corner, its age unknown.

But frozen so solid, it shouldn't have spoiled, right?

He found a small pot, threw in the frozen chicken breast to steam, and added three eggs.

While waiting, he took out a bag of biscuits and made himself a glass of milk.

"Woof." Tangyuan, standing by the table, suddenly barked.

Qin Xian glanced down at what he was holding and replied, "No, dogs can't drink milk. Don't ask me for it. Fine... here's a biscuit."

He had indeed left the dog hungry all morning. Qin Xian reluctantly tossed a biscuit over. Tangyuan easily caught it in its mouth, chewed it a couple of times, and swallowed it.

Qin Xian looked down and asked, "Was it good? If it was good, wag your tail."

Tangyuan tilted its head, not moving.

Qin Xian snorted coldly: "I'll throw it away tomorrow."

The dog's tail wagged.

Qin Xian's naming method—name your dog after what you just ate.

If it were me, the dog would be named Yangmei (杨梅), the food I just ate [doge emoji].

I removed some words from the synopsis (covered in blood and stepping on a dog) because I wanted to promote my work on XHS (Xinjiang Literature City) and it was judged to be vulgar. Seriously, even more sensitive than Jinjiang Literature City.
