Chapter 8 08 Let Nature Take Its Course

Cold sweat beaded on Mu Chen's forehead. He dared not speak, his eyes fixed on the filling in Yan Hanying's hand. He watched as Yan Hanying's slender fingers, seemingly unconcerned about the grease, picked it up and examined it closely.

The room fell silent. Countless eyes were fixed on Yan Hanying's hand. Suddenly, he laughed, tossed the filling to the ground, and lightly clapped his hands, saying, "Someone, bring in two birds."

A hidden guard, seemingly from nowhere, appeared instantly, holding two small sparrows in his hands, and fed the filling to the birds.

Yan Hanying chuckled, stroking the dog's head. "These two little sparrows aren't as easy to live as people. I'd like to see how long they survive after eating the pastries you personally brought as a gift for your classmates."

The young men in the room immediately erupted in a gasp.

"What?! The filling was poisoned?"

"Luckily I didn't eat it. If I had died, my parents would have been heartbroken."

"Is it really not a misunderstanding? Mu Chen was a bit arrogant before, but he doesn't seem like the type to harm a classmate."

"Of course it wasn't for harming a classmate," Yan Hanying was no longer concerned with being a villain. He was already angry when he heard someone intended to poison Jiang Jintang, and now that he had seen the culprit, he was even more furious, wanting nothing more than to skin the person alive.

He straightened up, his slender frame radiating an undeniable aura of pressure and killing intent, shielding Jiang Jintang behind him. "It's hard to say whether this Young Master Mu considers Jintang a classmate. Perhaps to him, Jintang is nothing more than a stranger he can die at any time, right?"

Jiang Jintang remained silent, seemingly lost in thought.

The two little sparrows, having eaten the filling, quickly succumbed to the poison, twitching only twice before breathing their last.

For a moment, the young man named Mu Chen turned pale, his back stiffening. After standing there for a while, he suddenly looked up, meeting Yan Hanying's probing gaze, and roared, "I killed treacherous officials like you, who aided and abetted the wicked and harmed innocent people. Only when you die sooner can the whole of Da Ning be restored to peace!"

The other young men immediately fell silent. Everyone knew Yan Hanying was a notorious traitor, and who dared to bring this matter up openly? Besides, their families owed their honor to Yan Hanying; who would dare risk their future by offending him?

So they all stood stiffly, not daring to utter a single word, fearing Mu Chen's wrath.

Seeing that Yan Hanying's smile remained unchanged, yet the atmosphere around him grew increasingly oppressive, Jiang Jintang sensed something was wrong. She quickly tugged at his sleeve and whispered in his ear, "Master, this person is the adopted son of Prince Shangjing."

"Prince Shangjing?" Yan Hanying said leisurely, "Oh, Mu Gaolang's adopted son. I wondered who dared to set their sights on me. Turns out, it's that prince from another clan who wanted to be regent but failed because of me."

He pronounced the words "prince from another clan" with deliberate emphasis.

Mu Chen knew that he was being reminded that his adoptive father, Prince Shangjing, was also a prince from another clan whose title was illegitimate, bestowed only through the power of the Empress Dowager, and who should have been powerless and without influence.

Mu Chen's face darkened instantly, and he remained speechless for a long while.

Yan Hanying, still ill, was also somewhat exhausted after his ordeal. He quickly hardened his expression and said, "Guards, seize this man and send him to the Red Gate Hall."

Yan Hanying always did this. Whoever offended him was easily seized and sent to the Red Gate Hall. Ten days or half a month later, a perhaps incomplete corpse would be returned.

Mu Chen, knowing Yan Hanying's methods, immediately flew into a rage and shouted, "How dare you treat me, Yan Hanying, like this! You will surely die a horrible death!"

Before he could even react, Jiang Jintang stepped forward and slapped him hard across the face.

*Slap!*

The sound was so loud that everyone was startled, as if they hadn't expected the usually gentle Jiang Jintang to have this side to him.

Jiang Jintang, his back to Yan Hanying, didn't seem to care about the sting in his palm, only staring at Mu Chen.

Mu Chen saw the cold killing intent in his eyes that he hadn't noticed before, and was momentarily stunned.

Jiang Jintang said softly, "If you don't want your tongue anymore, I can cut it off for you."

Yan Hanying was somewhat dazed.

Only at this moment did her realization that Jiang Jintang was a villain gradually become clear.

She had known Jiang Jintang was two-faced, but was this his true nature?

[Favorability +2, Current Favorability 40]

Yan Hanying blinked.

*

Today's events have temporarily come to an end, but despite Mu Chen's threatening words, Yan Hanying still sent him to the Red Gate Hall.

He was tired of hearing those phrases about Mu Chen dying a horrible death and being struck by lightning.

He had already died once; his life and death were in his own hands. He never entrusted what he could control to others. He never cared about fate or curses, nor did he get angry about them.

He arrested Mu Chen, partly because of Jiang Jintang.

This was a fact Yan Hanying had to admit. Even though he was now afraid that Jiang Jintang might kill him in the future, and even though he had previously boasted that he would kill Jiang Jintang, in a life-or-death situation, he still subconsciously protected the child he had raised.

Yan Hanying boarded the carriage, excluding Jiang Jintang. He leaned against the window, chin in hand, lost in thought, looking rather dejected.

The system, a dog, took Jiang Jintang's spot and followed him into the carriage.

Before boarding, it seemed to have seen Jiang Jintang give it a resentful look, but it hadn't seen clearly and wasn't sure if it had imagined it.

The system, however, was carefree and quickly forgot about it, wagging its tail happily and saying, "Host, I told you you could do it! The mission is complete, and the favorability rating has increased!"

"Why did the favorability rating increase?" Yan Hanying was perplexed. He couldn't understand it; without grasping the principle, he would never know how to properly win over Jiang Jintang.

"Oh, host, don't think so much. Just let nature take its course."

"Yes, yes," Yan Hanying said lazily, "Let nature take its course. When the time comes, Jiang Jintang will stab me to death with a sword."

System: "..."

Never seen such a cruel person.

Yan Hanying turned her face away again, lifting the curtain to look out the window.

The carriage was moving slowly. Jiang Jintang, holding an umbrella, was quietly following beside the carriage, his posture handsome and upright.

Yan Hanying really couldn't connect the young man who spoke to Mu Chen like that today with Jiang Jintang. It was as if today was just a daydream she had.

"By the way," Yan Hanying remembered something and asked, "Is that Mu Chen the protagonist?"

The system's voice choked in its throat, and it didn't speak for a long time, only making soft, whimpering noises. Yan Hanying found the dog's whining too noisy. Already feeling unwell, and now further irritated, she punched the system in the head and snapped, "Speak!"

"I'll talk, I'll talk," the dog stammered, rubbing its head on the ground, "He... he was supposed to be the protagonist, but now they're saying we're going to treat Jiang Jintang like the protagonist and try to win her over? So whether Mu Chen is the protagonist or not doesn't matter anymore."

"Easy for you to say," Yan Hanying sneered.

He fell silent, thinking to himself that whether Mu Chen was the protagonist or not was quite important. If Jiang Jintang really turned evil and things became irreversible, perhaps he would have to rely on the protagonist's protection; after all, only the protagonist can stop the villain.

Yan Hanying naturally didn't want that day to come, but everything is uncertain until it's close enough; she had to plan carefully.

Yan Hanying glanced at Jiang Jintang outside the carriage. The young man, who had been lifting his coat and stepping through the snow, seemed to notice Yan Hanying's gaze. He looked up, their eyes met, and Jiang Jintang smiled at him with his eyes crinkled.

Yan Hanying's heart was filled with mixed emotions, a jumble of thoughts running through her mind. Finally, her thoughts settled on the thought, "He's grown up," and she couldn't help but feel a chill.

Five years had passed so quickly. She vaguely remembered first seeing Jiang Jintang; he was still thin and small, standing two heads shorter than her.

He had grown up so rapidly.

[Affection +1, Current Affection 41]

Yan Hanying was lost in thought for a moment. Jiang Jintang had already quickly followed him to the window and softly called, "Master."

Yan Hanying blinked and hummed in response.

"Why did Master come to the academy today?" Jiang Jintang seemed somewhat hesitant. He didn't know when Yan Hanying had appeared there. If Yan Hanying often appeared mysteriously near the academy, had he perhaps seen something he shouldn't have?

He dared not think about it. The more he thought about it, the more he knew the possibility, and he felt a chill run down his spine and tremble all over. He desperately wanted to immediately deal with everyone who knew, to avoid the fear and anxiety of being discovered by his master.

He drifted off into thought for a moment, and Yan Hanying was also lost in thought. The master and disciple were similar at this moment, both absent-minded, calculating their next move.

After a while, Yan Hanying spoke first, saying, "You played Go quite well today."

Jiang Jintang hadn't expected him to answer so irrelevantly. "It was Master who saved the game."

"I know you have your own plans," Yan Hanying said meaningfully, "You had already laid out a strategy on the board. Even if I hadn't made that move, you could have turned the tide on your own."

Jiang Jintang remained silent.

After a while, he asked, "Is Master going to kill Mu Chen?"

"No," Yan Hanying said truthfully, "He's still useful."
