Chapter 12 12 Making the Mistakes Every Parent Makes

At midnight, Yuejiao came to wake Yan Hanying to get up and wash.

Winter days are inherently sleepy, and Yan Hanying sat half-asleep at the table waiting for Yuejiao to style his hair. Yuejiao carefully arranged his hair by candlelight, when suddenly she exclaimed, "Oh dear!"

"Don't startle me like that," Yan Hanying sighed; Yuejiao's exclamation had fully awakened him. "It'll frighten people."

"My lord," Yuejiao bent down and carefully examined the back of his neck, " "Perhaps there are insects in the house. Why are there red spots on the back of my neck? Could it be itchy?"

Yan Hanying was also a little puzzled and subconsciously reached up to touch the back of her neck. "Where is it?"

Yuejiao lightly touched it with her fingertip and said, "It doesn't look too serious. After the master goes to court, I'll have the cleaning staff come in and give it a good sweep and change the bedding."

Yan Hanying didn't feel itchy and didn't pay much attention to it.

Donning his official robes, he asked Yuejiao for a hand warmer. Holding it in his hands, he lightly weighed it and asked, "Is this new?"

"Yes, Young Master Jiang Jintang left before midnight, handing me this hand warmer, saying that the Master is frail and cannot be without a hand warmer and cloak, so a new one must always be on hand."

Jiang Jintang is thoughtful, Yan Hanying thought.

The initial gloom from the early morning court session lessened slightly because of the other's thoughtfulness. Yuejiao, holding an umbrella, accompanied Yan Hanying to the carriage, then folded the umbrella and placed it on the carriage floor.

Yan Hanying wasn't as harsh on his servants as rumored. He simply said, "Alright, no need to see me off. Go back and get some sleep."

"Oh, sir, Young Master Tang asked you what you'd like to eat after court today?"

"No need to prepare," Yan Hanying knew that court would likely be embroiled in the matter of Mu Chen, and he had no interest in whether or not to eat. "You can arrange it yourselves. Don't wait for me."

Any later and he'd be late. Yan Hanying sent Yuejiao back, lowered the thick curtains on the carriage windows to block the wind and snow, and finally couldn't help but sigh.

Since arriving in Daning, he had become quite familiar with everyone around him over the past five years. He treated them with the same warmth and friendliness he had shown back in his hometown, rarely showing any displeasure.

Perhaps because he hadn't slept well, Yan Hanying was prone to overthinking when drowsy. His mind was in turmoil as he thought about Jiang Jintang, his villainous role, and he truly didn't know how to prevent Jiang Jintang from turning evil.

His memory only mentioned that Jiang Jintang hated him for being strict. Yan Hanying admitted that he had indeed been too strict with Jiang Jintang's studies, making the mistake all parents make—forcing Jiang Jintang to be number one in every exam.

For so many years, Jiang Jintang had consistently ranked first in the imperial examinations.

These were indeed things Yan Hanying had done; he had no grounds for refutation. Yet, he felt that Jiang Jintang was so intelligent that he shouldn't be so confused, unable to distinguish between sincerity and pretense.

Yan Hanying was willing to trust Jiang Jintang, but the feeling of being pierced through the heart by him was so vividly etched in her mind. She thought she had forgotten, but she hadn't; the memory still made her feel dazed and uneasy.

If Jiang Jintang were to kill her indiscriminately in the future, what about the others in the mansion? Would the servants who had gotten along so well with him be implicated because of her?

Yan Hanying anxiously covered her face.

The carriage was already waiting outside the Meridian Gate. The palace gates were not yet open, and many officials were waiting there.

But Yan Hanying was different from ordinary officials; she simply ordered the palace gates to be opened and let him in.

The carriage entered the palace gates. He vaguely heard whispers, but didn't turn back to cause trouble, instructing the driver to continue.

The young emperor had only recently awakened, and palace maids were preparing him for his toilette. Yan Hanying, who always moved freely within the palace, treated the emperor's bedchamber as if it were her own residence, and her greeting to the young emperor was somewhat perfunctory.

The young emperor couldn't blame her. Yan Hanying now held power, and he was merely a puppet. Besides, he was still young and didn't understand many things. If he couldn't rely on Yan Hanying, he would have to submit to his grandmother's control.

His grandmother had many relatives, and his father wasn't her biological son. Although young, he could distinguish between close and distant relatives and dared not offend Yan Hanying.

Yan Hanying sat in the chair for a while, waiting for the young emperor to wash and dress.

While putting on his dragon robe, Yan Hanying suddenly said, "Your Majesty, you got up late today."

"Hmm..." the young emperor, somewhat guilty, said softly, "The wind and snow were heavy last night, and I had a hard time sleeping."

Yan Hanying could tell he was lying, but she didn't ask any further questions.

At dawn, it was time for court. Yan Hanying followed the young emperor to the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

After roll call, the meeting began. First, the current administrative situation and suggestions for each city were discussed. Yan Hanying paid little attention to these matters, but then he heard someone say, "The young marquis of Shangjing Prince's Mansion is still being held in custody by the Grand Master. The Empress Dowager is so worried about her nephew that she has fallen ill. If this gets out, it will truly damage the reputation of our Great Ning Dynasty."

"The Empress Dowager is just ill," Yan Hanying said, somewhat puzzled. "What does this have to do with the reputation of Great Ning? Or is it because Great Ning lacks skilled doctors, unable to even cure this minor emotional distress? That would easily make us look bad to outsiders."

His words were clever and flattering. In an instant, many officials angrily denounced him for disrespecting the imperial family and undermining the foundation of the state. Han Ying sneered, "That Mu Chen clearly has his own adoptive parents, and he's currently a farmer in the countryside. If he were a member of the royal family, would royalty be toiling in the fields to experience the hardships of ordinary people?"

"Yan Han Ying!" Prince Shangjing said indignantly, "Don't spread such alarmist rumors."

"I'm not the one spreading alarmist rumors," Yan Han Ying scoffed, "From beginning to end, it's you loyal ministers and generals who have been claiming a person of unknown origin to be a member of the royal family, talking about shaking the foundations of the nation. If the centuries-old foundation of Da Ning is so easily shaken, then everyone should consider other plans."

These words immediately caused an uproar in the court.

"Yan Hanying, how dare you curse Da Ning!"

"Truly outrageous!"

Yan Hanying was already tired of hearing these words. He glanced at the timid young emperor sitting on the throne, knowing that the young emperor was too old to govern, so he clapped his hands as usual and said, "If there is no important matter, then the court session is over. Submit your memorial to His Majesty."

"Submit it to His Majesty? In the end, won't it still fall into the hands of a castrated man like you?" "!" someone shouted angrily, "You, a mere eunuch, barely literate, dare to control the court and treat His Majesty as a puppet! What have you done without His Majesty's permission?!"

"What haven't you done without His Majesty's permission?" Yan Hanying smiled, turning to look at the nervous young emperor behind him, and asked, "Your Majesty, when have I ever acted without consulting you?"

The young emperor remained silent for a long while.

Yan Hanying narrowed his eyes slightly, seemingly urging, "Your Majesty."

"No!" the young emperor hurriedly interjected, "You... have always acted only after my permission. Don't make wild guesses."
