Chapter 15 15 Don't be angry

The system was somewhat saddened. "Don't ask about the aftereffects right away. Let's trust each other a little more."

"Given a flawed script and you've been gone for five years, causing me to choose the wrong lead actor, and now I'm reduced to having to act according to a junior's whim," Yan Hanying casually drew the longsword hanging beside her, a sinister sneer appearing on her face. "You say you want me to give you a little more trust?"

The dog, with its airplane ears and drooping tail, huddled in the corner. "Host, please calm down… the effects of the drug last for ten days. After the effects wear off, there will be a full-blown backlash, requiring thirty days of bed rest. During those thirty days, you'll be completely weak and unable to move."

Yan Hanying rotated her wrist, the light from the wall lamp reflecting a cold glint on the sword, catching the system's eye.

The system stammered, "Don't torture us like this!"

"Ten days for thirty days," Yan Hanying stood tall and elegant, her hand holding the sword pale and slender, yet her entire being resembled a vengeful ghost rising from the earth to claim a life, chilling the system to the bone. "Do you think I'm a victim of injustice?"

"That's not how it's calculated!" the system shouted. "Exactly! Think about it, you use it when you need it, and once it's safe, you only have to lie in bed for thirty days. Isn't that a worry-free life?"

Yan Hanying hesitated for a moment, realizing the logic in the statement, and asked again, "Are there really no other side effects?"

"Really, there aren't!"

"Alright," Yan... Han Ying waved her hand, saying, "Don't shout, outsiders will hear. Tell me about Mu Chen's sister, and I'll have someone look for her."

"You'll have to find her yourself," the system said cautiously. "That's how the mission is arranged..."

Yan Han Ying: "...?"

"You want me to go find her?" Yan Han Ying was almost laughing in exasperation at this idiot system. "If I have to do everything myself, what's the point of having a system like this? Besides, do you expect me to go directly to Mu Chen and ask him, 'Where's your sister?' Do you think he'll tell me?"

"Maybe," the system said hesitantly.

A moment later.

Standing before the rack, Yan Hanying asked numbly, "I heard you have a younger sister. Where is she now?"

"What do you want with her?" Mu Chen, covered in blood, his once handsome face now unrecognizable, only showing dishevelment and exhaustion, said softly, "She's still young, and a girl. Prince Shangjing won't care whether she lives or dies."

"No one cares what Prince Shangjing thinks," Yan Hanying said. "I have something to discuss with her."

"Ha," Mu Chen laughed, his voice hoarse, "You want something to discuss with her? She's only two years old. What could she possibly want?"

Yan Hanying knew all along that Mu Chen wouldn't tell her if she asked; in the end, she would have to find the child herself.

The system's mission was vague; they found the child, but didn't tell him what to do next, or what the purpose of his actions was.

Yan Hanying's face turned cold, but he didn't intend to use torture anymore. He only needed to force Mu Chen to put his fingerprint on the confession, then the two could be handed over to the Minister of Justice for processing. He wouldn't need to interfere in this man's affairs any further.

As for Jiang Jintang, he had read the script and knew that Jiang Jintang later opposed Mu Chen because she resented him for being academically superior. Moreover, Mu Chen was arrogant and haughty, while Jiang Jintang was easy to talk to; he often bullied Jiang Jintang at the academy.

If Mu Chen had died earlier, Jiang Jintang might not have turned evil so easily.

Yan Hanying planned to return to his residence first and then send someone to search for the child, but Mu Chen suddenly said, "Come closer, I can tell you where my sister is now."

Yan Hanying, thinking of him tightly bound to the rack, relaxed his guard and moved closer to Mu Chen, warning, "You'd better not try anything funny—"

Before he could finish the word "funny," he suddenly felt his cheek go weak and instinctively froze.

Mu Chen laughed hoarsely, a wild laugh.

Only then did Yan Hanying belatedly realize what had happened.

Mu Chen had actually kissed him.

His mind went blank, and he instinctively raised his hand and slapped Mu Chen hard across the face.

*Slap!*

Mu Chen's face was turned to the side by the slap, but he continued to laugh. It seemed the slap aggravated his wound, and he coughed, saying between coughs, "I noticed you back when I saw you at the academy. People say you're treacherous, cunning, and ruthless, but I never expected you to be so beautiful."

Yan Hanying belatedly blushed, overwhelmed with shame and anger, and shouted, "Mu Chen! How dare you humiliate me!"

"Humiliate you?" Mu Chen laughed, then dropped an even more shocking statement, "Back then, when my godfather looked at you, his gaze was far more blatant than mine. I don't know how many times he's defiled you in his heart."

As soon as he finished speaking, Yan Hanying raised her hand again.

This time, Mu Chen didn't close his eyes. He stared at him sternly and said, "You want to know where my sister is? She's being raised by the Zhang family in Guchuan Town. She was sold several times before ending up with my adoptive parents. She's not my biological sister. Finding her won't help."

"Whether it's helpful or not doesn't need you to remind me," Yan Hanying retorted, his anger still burning. He was stunned that such absurd things had happened to him and couldn't process it. He just wanted to escape.

He was furious. His gaze shifted, and he picked up a whip from the table, lashing it out at Mu Chen.

"Crack!"

The whip struck Mu Chen's chest, leaving a clear, bloody welt.

Mu Chen gasped, a strange bulge forming beneath him.

Yan Hanying, with his sharp eyes, noticed this and was immediately startled, throwing down the whip abruptly. "You're a complete madman!"

"Master?"

Jiang Jintang's voice suddenly rang out from behind. Yan Hanying turned around in alarm. Jiang Jintang had changed into a plain white robe, clutching a fox fur coat, looking completely out of place in the filthy, foul-smelling environment.

Yan Hanying's heart skipped a beat, his mind racing with thoughts of whether Jiang Jintang had seen him crack the whip, or seen Mu Chen kiss his cheek, or… or something else entirely.

His mind was in turmoil. He only heard Jiang Jintang say, "I was worried that Master was cold, so I came to bring him some clothes..."

Yan Hanying took a step back, as if suffering from homophobia, even feeling incredibly uneasy under Jiang Jintang's concerned and sincere gaze.

He took another step back. Jiang Jintang's face showed a hint of confusion and grievance as she asked, "Master, did I do something that displeased you?"

The constantly appearing favorability reports made Yan Hanying's mood increasingly chaotic. He hurriedly thought of stabilizing Jiang Jintang's favorability first, saying, "I didn't dislike you, you..."

He panicked for a moment, then blurted out without thinking, "Don't be angry."

As soon as he finished speaking, the favorability reports sounded again.
