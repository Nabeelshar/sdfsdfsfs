Chapter 20 Because I'm a Transmigrator

New Year's Eve was approaching, and the snow had been falling incessantly for the past few days, making this winter exceptionally cold.

In the Yan residence, Jiang Jintang ordered the servants to purchase some paper-cut window lanterns and had them hung on the eaves of the main gate.

Jiang Jintang was still in his room, the candlelight flickering gently on the table. He gripped his sleeve, picked up his brush, and stood before the table, writing for a while. Suddenly, a servant stood by the window and whispered, "Young Master, the Master has been confined to his quarters."

"Hmm?" Jiang Jintang's voice rose slightly at the end. The servant wasn't sure if he was surprised or had expected this, but continued, "This morning, there was another dispute in court regarding Mu Chen with Prince Shangjing. His Majesty issued an edict temporarily revoking the Master's authority to approve imperial edicts and ordering him to remain in the palace to recuperate."

"Only..." "Is it temporary?"

"Yes, if the case isn't closed in two months, Your Excellency's rights will be restored."

Jiang Jintang's hand, which was holding a pen, paused for a moment. He straightened up slightly, raised his eyes, and a mocking smile appeared on his face. "This hypocritical little emperor, on one hand, listens to slander and wants to take back his power, and on the other hand, worries that if his master really falls from power, he will lose his backer. His master wholeheartedly serves such a foolish person."

The servant dared not respond to the criticism of His Majesty, fearing that he too would lose his head, and remained silent.

Jiang Jintang lowered his eyes again, finished writing the letter, and waited for the ink to dry completely. He folded the letter, stuffed it into an envelope, and handed it to a servant. "Tell Master to come back. Don't let him stay in the palace. If we really have to wait two months..."

His voice trailed off. After the servant left, he sighed and said, "By then, the New Year celebrations will be over."

Yan Hanying spent the entire day in the young emperor's palace.

The young emperor was just over ten years old, a time when he lacked his own opinions. He usually acted on his own orders, or occasionally on the Empress Dowager's. However, he was still discerning about who was closer to him and who was less so.

Yan Hanying and the Empress Dowager were vying for power, maintaining a balance. If Yan Hanying were to fall from grace and the Empress Dowager seized sole power, it would be uncertain whether Jiang Jintang could still secure his throne.

The young emperor had always relied on Yan Hanying, and Yan Hanying couldn't understand why he had suddenly changed his mind and decided to confine him to his quarters.

Although he held the administrative power, the emperor had personally ordered confinement in front of many officials, and considering public opinion, he had no choice but to obey.

Back in his palace, the young emperor remained timid and furtive, constantly stealing glances at Yan Hanying.

Yan Hanying didn't intend to take his anger out on the young emperor. It was indeed a good thing that the young emperor had his own opinions at such a young age, but this matter was so strange; he feared someone was interfering.

Who could it be?

Yan Hanying rested her chin on her hand, watching the eunuchs and palace maids moving around her. Most of them were spies she had selected and sent to the palace to monitor the young emperor and those around him. She had questioned them all, and they all said that the young emperor hadn't seen any outsiders lately, only attending ancestral rites with the Empress Dowager.

A few words from the Empress Dowager alone probably wouldn't be enough to shake the young emperor's resolve or embolden him to oppose her in court.

Yan Hanying was getting a headache. He rested his head on his hand, closed his eyes, and took a short nap. Qingmeng came to bring him medicine, saying, "My lord, this is some medicine His Majesty sent. He said your face looked pale, and he suspected your cold had worsened."

Yan Hanying then noticed that the young emperor was no longer in the hall. He spoke, only then realizing his voice was a little hoarse, "Where is His Majesty?"

"He said he was too bored staying in the hall and went for a walk in the Imperial Garden."

"Who went with him?"

"Kangde," Qingmeng said, "A couple of days ago, His Majesty's paper kite fell into the water, and it was Kangde who retrieved it. His Majesty has always valued Kangde highly, taking him everywhere."

Yan Hanying gave a soft "hmm," thinking to himself, "Valued, perhaps not."

If he truly valued the emperor, he would have brought him before him long ago. He's probably someone planted by the young emperor's side.

Yan Hanying sighed, drank his medicine, and said, "The snow is heavy outside. Summon His Majesty back. I have something to discuss with him."

"Yes."

Qing Meng left after receiving the message. Yan Hanying walked around the young emperor's palace and reviewed his policy proposals.

They were still as bad as ever.

The royal family no longer had any children of the late emperor; otherwise, with the young emperor so incompetent, the throne would never have been his.

Yan Hanying rested his chin on his hand, not knowing how long he had waited. Perhaps it was the brazier in the palace that had warmed the room, but he felt tired and sleepy.

He suddenly thought, if Mu Chen were the male lead, and an orphan...

Could Mu Chen… be a royal heir lost among the common people?

He couldn't think any further, and instantly slumped onto the table, falling into a deep sleep.

"Ding-a-ling—"

The sound of bells echoed through the snow. A tall, slender figure stood before the Yan residence, holding a lantern, like a solitary statue.

Only when the carriage gradually approached from the end of the road did Jiang Jintang's expression flicker slightly, and she rose to greet it.

The carriage stopped in front of the residence. Jiang Jintang boarded the carriage. Yan Hanying was fast asleep on a soft cushion, her lips pale, but her cheeks rosy.

This morning, before the sun rose, she hadn't seen clearly in the lamplight and hadn't realized that Yan Hanying was ill.

Jiang Jintang lowered his eyes, carefully lifted the man, and carried him back to the mansion.

Throughout the journey, Yan Hanying showed no signs of waking.

Jiang Jintang placed him on the couch, intending to rise, but then, as if unable to restrain himself, he leaned down and kissed Yan Hanying's lips.

The kiss was brief, yet he felt increasingly unsatisfied. Seeing that Yan Hanying had no further reaction, he couldn't help but lean down again, kissing from the corner of his lips to his Adam's apple, then to his collarbone.

He removed Yan Hanying's official robes, like peeling the skin of a delicious fruit, finally revealing the tender white flesh.

Jiang Jintang held Yan Hanying as they lay down on the couch, his arms wrapped around Yan Hanying's waist as they had when they were children, resting against his chest, listening to his heartbeat.

But he was no longer a child; he understood love and relationships. His longing for his mentor, who had raised him, grew stronger with age, a constant, unbearable itch, like ants gnawing at his skin. He craved further intimacy, yet feared pushing Yan Hanying further away.

Now, he could only offer fleeting, dishonorable embraces, like a maggot stealing its prey.

“Master…”

Jiang Jintang, feeling somewhat aggrieved, whispered, “Please stay with me these next few days.”

“I’ve missed five years of New Year’s celebrations,” Jiang Jintang said, half-burying her face in Yan Hanying’s arms. Her figure, already so tall, was now huddled up, looking pitiful as she murmured to herself, “Even just this year?”

Just this day, perhaps that would be enough.

Jiang Jintang closed her eyes.

The next day, Yan Hanying slept until noon, opening her eyes and gazing blankly at the familiar bed railings and curtains.

Was she back?

When did she return to the manor?

Yan Hanying sat up blankly, her body aching and weak, her head spinning, and her throat dry and sore as if she had swallowed burning coals.

He leaned back on the cushions to recover. The system was the first to notice he was awake. A dog jumped in excitedly through the window, rattling things off the table and making Yan Hanying's headache worse.

The system exclaimed excitedly, "Host, you're amazing! I haven't even come to you yet, how did you know what the next mission was!"

"Because I'm from another world," Yan Hanying said listlessly, "Actually, there's something I've never told you: all of your systems were created by my own hands in the modern world."

System: Huh?
