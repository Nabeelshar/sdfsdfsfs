Chapter 6 06 The Tyrannical Contract

Jiang Jintang was supposed to go to the academy today, but after leaving the mansion, she didn't head there. Instead, she went to the dungeon that Yan Hanying had privately built outside the mansion.

It was called a dungeon, but it was more like a torture chamber. Yan Hanying even called it the Red Gate Hall. Prisoners were often taken there for private torture, and almost no one who entered the Red Gate Hall ever came out dead.

Yan Hanying had never mentioned this place to Jiang Jintang, fearing that it would make Jiang Jintang dislike him. However, after using private torture so often, and even killing a few henchmen of his political enemies, the matter could no longer be kept secret.

There were frequent accusations against Yan Hanying within the court, but unfortunately, all the memorials fell into Yan Hanying's hands. The young emperor was too young to manage affairs, and the rumors reached Yan Hanying's ears; he either ignored them or used them for retaliatory purposes.

Jiang Jintang had heard of Yan Hanying's treacherous and cunning nature when he was fifteen. He was said to be ruthless and merciless, with only allies and enemies in the court. Those who weren't friends rarely stayed long—they either died without cause or were demoted.

Except for military power, Yan Hanying had long since gained complete control of the court.

That was when Yan Hanying asked his teacher at the academy to see him. The teacher led him out and stood before Yan Hanying.

Jiang Jintang carefully observed the young man before him. He appeared frail, as if chronically ill, yet possessed gentle features and a handsome, ethereal face, like a celestial being descended to earth.

Yan Hanying took his hand and led him to the carriage. Jiang Jintang noticed the coldness of Yan Hanying's hand.

No wonder he always carried a hand warmer.

Jiang Jintang was lost in thought. He stood before the red gate for a while, then the wind and snow intensified, the cold wind cutting like knives against his face. He snapped out of his reverie, his brows furrowing again with indifference. He lowered his gaze, lifted the hem of his robe, and stepped over the threshold into the carriage.

The guards outside the red gate rarely saw Jiang Jintang approach. Yan Hanying treated him like a precious jewel, keeping him away from bloodshed and violence, afraid he might be tainted.

Upon seeing Jiang Jintang, the two guards were somewhat surprised and quickly bowed to him. "Young Master, what brings you here today?"

"I've come to handle some matters for my master," Jiang Jintang said coldly, taking out some silver and placing it in the guards' hands. He added, "My master is still seriously ill, and it's inconvenient for him to come to such a bloody place. If any murder occurs, don't tell him. If he asks, just say he died of illness."

Jiang Jintang didn't specify anyone, but the guards knew that recently, the Chief Inspector had only been executing one person in the torture chamber.

That person was already half-dead and nearly breathless.

Seeing Jiang Jintang's cold expression, seemingly tinged with murderous intent, the two guards felt a chill run down their spines. They knew Jiang Jintang might not be as gentle and innocent as they thought, so they agreed.

Jiang Jintang then entered the dungeon, her white shoes, embroidered with gold thread, crunching through the bloodstains and filth, slowly disappearing deeper into the dungeon.

The cell door creaked open, and a stench assaulted their nostrils.

Jiang Jintang frowned, raised his hand to cover his mouth and nose, then smiled and asked the jailer beside him, "Is this the person Master spoke of who poisoned me?"

"Yes, young master."

"In that case," Jiang Jintang casually took an iron branding iron from the brazier and said softly, "Since it's aimed at me, why trouble Master to do it himself?"

The firelight flickered, reflecting on his curved eyebrows.

"Bang bang—"

Something was banging on the door.

Yan Hanying, restless, mumbled, "Who is it? Get in."

A dog rolled in.

Although the system was currently in dog form and couldn't display human expressions, Yan Hanying still saw obsequiousness on the dog's face.

He covered his face, his fever still high, veins throbbing on his forehead, the pain so intense he felt like killing someone, and his temper was terrible.

The system knew it had touched a nerve, and immediately became cautious yet hesitant, unsure whether to tell Yan Hanying the truth.

Yan Hanying closed his eyes for a short rest, the dog's breathing constantly beside the bed impossible to ignore, and couldn't help but ask, "What do you want to say?"

"Host," the system said, "I think you can't just lie here waiting to die."

"I won't wait to die," Yan Hanying said, "Once the coffin is ready, I'll contact Qu Ning for help, say I choked to death on something, have me buried hastily, and then leave through the underground passage."

Yan Hanying had meticulously planned everything during his half-day in bed, arranging every detail carefully, fearing any unforeseen circumstances.

He said, "The tunnel should lead to Quqingliao Prefecture. Then I can have a wandering sorcerer disguise me, and I can walk straight out of the city gate to Wule Township to do business, or perhaps open an academy and become a teacher."

Yan Hanying spoke earnestly, the dog pacing anxiously, finally unable to hold back any longer, saying, "Host!"

Yan Hanying stopped speaking.

The dog, excited, exclaimed, "Maybe if we max out his favorability, Jiang Jintang won't turn evil!"

"Heh," Yan Hanying sneered, "Rather than make this bet, I'd rather go and die with him right now."

He made a move to get up, but the dog suddenly grabbed his clothes. "Calm down! Calm down! Actually, this time-travel thing is a tyrannical contract. It's too late to give up now. If you don't complete the favorability conquest within the allotted time, you'll be completely annihilated, your body and soul destroyed, unable to reincarnate, unable to be reborn, and destined to spend your entire life in a cauldron of boiling oil in the underworld!"

Yan Hanying: "?"

Yan Hanying thought he misheard. "What? I'll be in a cauldron of boiling oil? By what means?"

"Because you've already signed this tyrannical contract!"

"I haven't signed it."

"You have!" "When you died, the main system held your hand and personally pressed its fingerprint on it."

Yan Hanying didn't believe it at all. "Then show it to me."

The system couldn't produce it; the system was just a dog now.

Just as he was thinking of a solution, Yan Hanying was already bending down to put on his shoes and socks, coughing heavily as he said, "Don't try to trick me into staying here to die. Even if I die, I will never die at Jiang Jintang's hands."

He put on his shoes and stood up, when suddenly he heard a noise outside.

A moment later, Jiang Jintang's white clothes swayed by the door, and she appeared before Yan Hanying.

Yan Hanying paused.

He noticed bloodstains on Jiang Jintang's sleeve, the source of which was unclear. Because the sleeve was pristine white, the bloodstains were particularly noticeable, and he even smelled of blood on Jiang Jintang. Jiang Jintang made no attempt to conceal it, simply carrying it openly.

Seeing Yan Hanying stand up, he narrowed his eyes and approached her, saying, "Master is awake? Jintang, check if Master's cold is any better."

He raised his hand, and Yan Hanying felt a surge of tension, instinctively reaching for the sword lying to the side.

His finger twitched, and the system, knowing his intention, quickly stepped in front of him, blocking him from Jiang Jintang.

Jiang Jintang glanced down and saw the superfluous and troublesome dog. His previously gentle smile instantly turned icy and murderous, but his tone remained normal as he asked, "Master, how did this dog get into the house?"

"I let it in," Yan Hanying replied. He still wanted to take his sword, but the moment the thought crossed his mind, his favorability rating plummeted, already dropping below forty.

Although Yan Hanying said he didn't believe him, his life was at stake, and he was somewhat nervous, so he had to suppress the thought.

Jiang Jintang continued, "I'm going to the academy now, Master. I'll be back early tonight."

Yan Hanying's lips trembled, and after a long pause, he responded with a soft "Mm."

Jiang Jintang walked away, turning back every few steps.

Yan Hanying slumped weakly into a chair, covering her face in utter helplessness.

The system said, "Seriously, host, think it over carefully. His favorability rating doesn't seem that hard to raise. Wasn't I already fifty when I arrived?"

"It's not as easy as you think," Yan Hanying sighed, thinking she really shouldn't have transmigrated.

Come to think of it, when she transmigrated, it seemed she wasn't given much of a choice.

The system breathed a sigh of relief, secretly pulled out the script, glanced at it, and said, "Host, you still have a mission. If you can fix the messed-up ending and increase the protagonist's affection, you can go home."

"The new mission is... um..."

The system fell silent. Suddenly, a notification popped up in Yan Hanying's mind:

[Please go to the academy to stop Jiang Jintang from eating the pastries given to him by his classmates]

Yan Hanying subconsciously asked, "Why? I gave them to the child because he likes them; it's not like I poisoned him."

System: "..."

Yan Hanying: "...Was it really poisoned?"
