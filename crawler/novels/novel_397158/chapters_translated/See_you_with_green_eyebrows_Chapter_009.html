Chapter 9 09 Coveting My Master's Beauty

The snow had been falling for many days without stopping. Yan Hanying had captured a student from the academy who intended to poison his classmates. For several days, the academy was deserted. Many powerful families abandoned the idea of sending their children there, and even Jiang Jintang stopped going to the academy, spending his days reading at home.

Yan Hanying came down from the court. He had been ill for several days and had not fully recovered. The court was drowsy, and he could only hear the ministers arguing. The young emperor, not taking charge, kept tugging at his sleeve, asking what to do.

Yan Hanying didn't hear a word he said and couldn't offer any solutions, only saying that they would discuss it later.

The courtiers were immediately in an uproar. Shortly after, Yan Hanying received his first impeachment of the day, accusing him of illegally detaining the son of Prince Shangjing without a joint trial by the three judicial departments.

Yan Hanying scoffed coldly, "The son of Prince Shangjing? Just an adopted son. He can't be listed in the family genealogy, and he won't be enshrined in the ancestral hall after his death. At most, he's a servant with a title, not a minor marquis. Why bother the Three Judicial Offices with your overstepping authority to punish a criminal servant?"

Upon finishing speaking, Prince Shangjing, his face ashen, suddenly roared, "I used to treat Mu Chen like my own son. Calling him a marquis wouldn't have been an exaggeration. It's just that I haven't had time to request a title yet. He is a member of my royal family, a noble member of the imperial clan. How dare you try to stir up trouble and insult the dignity of my royal family!"

"Royal dignity, my dear," Yan Hanying's tone suddenly turned icy, "An adopted son of unknown origin can be given a fictitious marquis title." "Poisoning a classmate? That child is my disciple, I'll protect him. If he were just a poor man's son, wouldn't I be able to kill him at will?"

"No one says the young marquis is right to murder his classmate," someone retorted sharply. "Right and wrong should be decided by the three judicial departments. Taking private punishment is a provocation against the laws of Da Ning."

"The Grand Secretary has long been at odds with the Prince. His actions this time are probably just to settle personal scores and eliminate dissidents. The guards in the Grand Secretary's residence are still in danger of dying in your Red Gate Hall. How can you talk about fairness and impartiality!"

Yan Hanying frowned, realizing that the Empress Dowager was likely backing him, which was why these officials, who usually dared not speak out, had stepped forward to accuse him.

Yan Hanying was troubled and confused, but then she thought, her reputation was already mediocre, so detaining a nobody was nothing. Even if the officials argued until they were hoarse, the person was still in her hands.

Therefore, she laughed again, crossed her arms, and said, "The one who was poisoned is my disciple. What can I do by detaining him? I'll wait for the Prince to bring evidence to prove Mu Chen's innocence before I consider whether to release him. Otherwise, you might abuse your power for personal gain like I did, and this matter will simply be dropped."

She wasn't trying to discuss anything; she simply chuckled, announced the end of court for the young emperor, and left with him, ignoring the discussions in the court.

The young emperor, now ten years old, was at an age of innocent ignorance. As he walked with Yan Hanying towards his bedchamber, he couldn't help but ask, "Is the Grand Secretary really going to kill my brother?"

"What kind of brother is he?" Yan Hanying said coldly. "Even if he were the son of Prince Shangjing, he's surnamed Mu, not Wei. At most, he's a relative of the imperial family. If he's allowed to act so arrogantly, when he gets too powerful, poison will be in your bowl."

The young emperor bit his lower lip, perhaps out of fear, and remained silent for a moment.

Yan Hanying continued, "From Your Majesty's words, have you met with this Mu Chen before?"

Having raised Jiang Jintang for so many years, Yan Hanying often entered the palace to accompany the young emperor. Ostensibly, she was there to educate the young emperor, but in reality, it was to consolidate her power. Usually, Yan Hanying reviewed all the memorials, and the young emperor was only responsible for summoning them.

Recently, due to numerous affairs at home and Jiang Jintang's upcoming imperial examinations, Yan Hanying had spent less time in the palace, leaving only spies among his spies. No one had informed him of Mu Chen's existence.

If he hadn't visited the academy recently, he wouldn't have known that the true protagonist was also there, and even more so, that he was the adopted son of Prince Shangjing.

The young emperor simply nodded in agreement, and Yan Hanying didn't ask any further questions. After leaving the palace, he didn't return to his residence immediately but instead went to the Red Gate Hall.

A string of bells hung from the carriage, and as the wheels rolled, the bells jingled softly.

Normally, when Yan Hanying traveled between the palace and her residence, the streets would make way for her. Privately, people said she looked like a ghostly procession, a harsh compliment, but Yan Hanying found it apt and had no intention of arguing.

Now, with the cold snow and few people on the streets, the sound of bells made the surroundings even more tranquil. The bells jingled all the way, finally stopping before the Red Gate Hall.

Yan Hanying lifted the curtain and looked out. Prince Shangjing stood before the Red Gate, seemingly filled with anger with nowhere to vent it, enduring the wind and snow.

Yan Hanying chuckled, "What, you didn't finish your argument in court, so you've come to argue with me in private?"

"I don't want to argue with you," said Prince Shangjing. "In the end, Mu Chen is just an adopted son; his life or death is none of my business."

"Since it's none of your concern, I'll kill him."

"Yan Hanying!" Prince Shangjing roared, "You insist on opposing me! I wronged you back then; if you want to vent your anger, vent it on me, but don't harm the innocent."

"You're quite magnanimous," Yan Hanying smiled, "You know you were the one who wronged me." "I've said everything you could want, good and bad, making me seem like the most unreasonable person around."

He hugged the hand warmer tighter, his smile fading as his patience wore thin. He simply said, "If you truly don't care about Mu Chen's life or death, then don't bother me anymore."

He stopped looking at Prince Shangjing and turned to walk towards the red door. Unexpectedly, Prince Shangjing grabbed his wrist and yanked hard. The hand warmer Yan Hanying was holding slipped from his grasp and fell to the ground, the incense and charcoal scattering and landing in the snow, quickly extinguishing into a patch of charred ashes.

Yan Hanying's expression turned cold as she struggled with her wrists, saying, "Let go!"

"If you hadn't lied first, why would I have kept you with the late emperor? Now you have everything you want, power and money at your fingertips. What more could you possibly want?"

"What does it matter to you that these things are in my hands?" Yan Hanying retorted. "I obtained them through my own hard work, unlike you, who, despite being a member of the royal family, expects to be waited on hand and foot, lies easily, and can easily break promises, then blame me for being ruthless."

Prince Shangjing fell silent for a moment, as if lost in thought.

Yan Hanying broke free of his grasp and took a step back, when suddenly someone tugged at her, pulling her behind that person.

Yan Hanying was taken aback. "Jin Tang?"

"Why is Your Highness harassing my master?" Jiang Jin Tang was already as tall as Prince Shangjing. Although dressed in a blue robe and appearing scholarly, his aura was exceptionally cold and carried an undeniable killing intent as he stood before Prince Shangjing. He said, "Could it be that you also covet my master's beauty, using the pretext of 'fighting traitors' to harass him?"

Prince Shangjing choked on his words. Yan Hanying was also startled by his words and quickly pulled him closer. "What nonsense are you spouting? I'm a man! What does he covet—"

The last word trailed off as Yan Hanying saw the barely concealed anger in Jiang Jin Tang's eyes. For a moment, she was bewildered and at a loss, only hearing her favorability rating fluctuate wildly.

[Affection -2, Current Affection 39]

[Affection +3, Current Affection 42]

Ultimately, after fluctuating up and down, it stopped at forty-five.
