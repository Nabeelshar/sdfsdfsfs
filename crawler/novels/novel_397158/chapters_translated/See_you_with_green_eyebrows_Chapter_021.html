Chapter 21 Like a canary trapped in a cage

The dog stood there blankly for a moment, then remained silent.

Yan Hanying had a terrible headache. Strangely enough, his health hadn't been good before he transmigrated; he was a frequent visitor to the hospital since childhood, needing two IV drips every day.

Unexpectedly, even after arriving in Da Ning and possessing someone else's body, he still had the same old problems.

The old house didn't have heating or air conditioning, and he was catching colds more and more frequently.

Yan Hanying sat up, clutching his head, feeling dizzy. He sat on the edge of the couch for a while, and as he looked down for his shoes and socks, he noticed the system still squatting there, dumbfounded.

Yan Hanying found it amusing and suddenly felt like teasing it. He rested his chin on his hand and asked, "What, what have you figured out with that tiny little brain of yours?"

The system didn't understand, and was even a little panicked. "No, buddy, is everything you said true?"

"Still struggling with that," Yan Hanying said, looking down as he put on his shoes, then coughed twice. "Of course I was lying to you."

System: "..."

Whether it was lying or not, it was so calm. No wonder the system couldn't tell the difference.

The system reassured itself, thinking that it wasn't stupid, it was all Yan Hanying's fault.

Yan Hanying didn't know what the dog was thinking. He got up, feeling utterly exhausted, and went to call Yuejiao to bring him some calming incense.

He asked absentmindedly, "What was the task you mentioned before? To have your imperial approval authority revoked by the emperor?"

"Yes, that's right," the system wagged its tail and sat down beside Yan Hanying, mumbling as it bit into the plum Yan Hanying casually handed it to it. "Didn't I have a system problem? I couldn't connect to your brain, so I couldn't bind the host and follow you. I was supposed to give you the task when you went to court. You needed to make the young emperor suspicious of you, have your imperial approval authority revoked, and be confined to the palace. Then, during your confinement, you needed to kill one of the young emperor's trusted eunuchs."

"What a coincidence," Yan Hanying thought, resting her chin on her hand.

He was initially somewhat displeased when the young emperor issued the decree, and even considered forcing the emperor to retract it. However, he hesitated for a moment, inexplicably remembering that New Year's Eve was only half a month away.

Since arriving in Daning, he seemed to have never spent a New Year's holiday at his residence, always accompanying the young emperor in the palace.

The palace was always dull and tedious. The palace banquets, though seemingly lively, were all masked by pretense, leaving him exhausted after each event.

If there were no political affairs, perhaps he could stay at his residence for New Year's Eve this year.

But because of this sudden thought, his momentary hesitation made it impossible for him to retract his decree.

After court, he overheard whispers about how Yan Hanying had changed his ways, no longer resisting.

Yan Hanying wasn't sure what he was thinking at the time, but by a twist of fate, he completed the task.

Yue Jiao went to prepare his medicine, returning halfway through, beaming with joy, and asked Yan Hanying what he wanted for lunch.

Yan Hanying thought this little girl had a good attitude; knowing she was under house arrest by the emperor, she wasn't worried about his downfall.

Watching the girl's departing figure, he suddenly asked the system, "What punishment will there be if the task isn't completed?"

The system exclaimed in surprise, "You only think to ask now?"

Yan Hanying's expression turned cold. "Don't talk nonsense."

He had been startled by the news that Jiang Jintang was the villain, his mind was in turmoil, and he hadn't had time to think about anything else. The system hadn't given him many tasks, so he hadn't thought to ask.

Seeing that Jiang Jintang was still obedient and compliant, and having figured out a solution, he finally had time to study the system and the mission.

The system said, "Didn't we tell you last time to raise the villain as the male lead? If you can gain enough favor with the villain and complete the mission, you can avoid repeating the same mistake, and then you can both live happily ever after."

Yan Hanying felt that the phrase "live happily ever after" sounded familiar, but he couldn't remember where he had heard it before, and it just felt a little awkward.

He said, "Alright, I understand."

Just as he was about to speak again, the sound of footsteps on snow suddenly came from the courtyard, and both he and the system fell silent, saying no more.

Soon, Jiang Jintang appeared outside the room. Snowflakes clung to his shoulders and hair. He didn't rush inside, but stood outside shaking off the snow, seemingly unaware that the window was slightly ajar, and Yan Hanying was watching him.

Jiang Jintang's hands were slightly red from the cold wind and snow. He gently breathed on his fingers to warm them up a bit before knocking on the door and saying, "Master."

"Come in," Yan Hanying said, lowering his eyes. He couldn't help but think that Jiang Jintang was always so obedient. He had previously told him to be more respectful, to knock and greet before entering, and Jiang Jintang had always complied.

He liked Jiang Jintang very much, but he couldn't help thinking that Mu Chen was the male lead, and his target was already in his grasp. Why couldn't he just turn the tables and go find Mu Chen?

However, Yan Hanying felt guilty. Despite mentally preparing himself, he still couldn't bring himself to send Jiang Jintang out of the manor and part ways with her. Taking Mu Chen from Prince Shangjing also seemed impractical.

Yan Hanying was lost in thought when Jiang Jintang had already tidied his bedding and poured warm water for him, saying, "Master suddenly caught a cold and developed a high fever last night. His Majesty said that recuperating at home would help calm the mind, so he had someone bring Master back."

Yan Hanying hummed in agreement, hesitated for a moment, then couldn't help but ask, "Jintang, Master has something to ask you."

Jiang Jintang subtly kicked the dog away, squatted down beside Yan Hanying, and smiled up at him, "Please speak, Master."

"If...if I were to bring someone back, would you think it inappropriate?" He paused, then remembered Mu Chen's younger sister, and quickly changed his words, "Bring two children."

Jiang Jintang's smile faded slightly, as if she hadn't quite come to her senses, "Is Master looking to hire new servants?"

"No," Yan Hanying replied, unsure himself. Why was he always so cautious, as if he might accidentally hurt Jiang Jintang's feelings? "What I mean is, we want to adopt two more children. Mu Chen has a younger sister, only two years old, and I want to bring her back to the manor to take care of her."

Jiang Jintang subconsciously wanted to ask why, but the words caught in her throat. After a long pause, she forced a smile and said, "Master is compassionate towards children and does good deeds. She's just a young child; bringing her back wouldn't be a problem—"

"I also want to bring Mu Chen back," Yan Hanying said hastily, his eyes lowered. "I know you'll resent him for poisoning you, but he's also a clever man. I'm thinking of bringing his sister back. He's wary of having a hostage in my hands. If she can be used by me, even if not sincerely, just for a little bit, in the future—"

But when he got to the future, he suddenly couldn't continue. Yan Hanying merely suspected that Mu Chen might be a prince who had fallen into poverty and lived among the common people; otherwise, why would Prince Shangjing have adopted a mere country bumpkin as his son?

He planned to bring Mu Chen back first, then have someone investigate his background. Once Mu Chen's identity was confirmed as he suspected, he could then help him ascend the throne, and then…

Then what? He couldn't understand it. Serving a decisive and charismatic emperor seemed ingrained in his very being, becoming a strange obsession.

Yan Hanying was momentarily dazed. Jiang Jintang, who had been squatting beside him, suddenly stood up, and Yan Hanying looked up, staring blankly at her.

The young man's shadow enveloped him; though they were clearly master and disciple, he felt like a canary trapped in a cage, completely suppressed and enveloped by the oppressive aura emanating from Jiang Jintang.

Jiang Jintang was backlit, his face somewhat blurred, and the emotions in his eyes difficult to discern; his smile was gone, giving him a somewhat cold appearance.

Yan Hanying subconsciously called out, "Jintang..."

"Why does Master need to explain to me?" Jiang Jintang's voice was soft, seemingly indifferent, yet not quite. "The Yan residence is Master's home. I was able to live here thanks to Master's care. Over the years, Master has already bestowed upon me so much for my food, clothing, shelter, studies, and examinations. I am endlessly grateful. How could I dare ask Master to be kind only to me?"

"The medicine is almost ready," Jiang Jintang turned around. "I'll go get it."

Yan Hanying hesitated for a moment, but Jiang Jintang was already gone.

He stood up, feeling empty inside, as if he had lost something.

Jiang Jintang seemed unhappy. Yan Hanying thought that he had actually considered that Jiang Jintang might not be comfortable. After all these years, he was practically an only child. Even in modern families with two or three children, there are times when the first child feels unbalanced; Jiang Jintang might not be immune either. Seeing Jiang Jintang's dejected look, Yan Hanying felt a pang of sadness.

Perhaps there was another way to achieve the best of both worlds.

Yan Hanying sighed and sat back down in her chair.
