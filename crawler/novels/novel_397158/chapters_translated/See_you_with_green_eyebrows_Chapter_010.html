Chapter 10 10 Disgust

Yan Hanying was still lost in thought when Jiang Jintang continued, "Silence means admission. I don't know exactly how Your Highness judged my master when you taught Mu Chen, but I can guess. To utter such sharp words, you must have taught him quite a bit through your words and actions."

As if Jiang Jintang had hit the nail on the head, Prince Shangjing's expression changed drastically, and he roared, "Nonsense!"

"Fine," Jiang Jintang sneered, "What I said to my master is nonsense; only what your Mu family said is true."

"Jintang." Yan Hanying pulled him closer, worried that he had offended Prince Shangjing. Although she herself was a powerful minister second only to the emperor, wielding considerable influence, she wasn't someone who could sit back and enjoy her position without restraint. If the power of the maternal relatives exerted pressure, she might find it difficult to protect Jiang Jintang.

“Don’t be rude,” he scolded in a low voice, then asked, “What are you doing here?”

Jiang Jintang, seemingly still breathless, his chest heaving, could only swallow his anger and reply, restrained by Yan Hanying’s intervention, “Master is ill. He previously said he would handle miscellaneous matters to ease his burden. Today, while Master was in court, someone from the Red Gate Hall came and said someone had died, so I came to see and, incidentally, dealt with the body.”

He paused, then, as if suddenly remembering something, lowered his eyes and said, “It was also the first time I’d ever seen a dead person. I was a little terrified and uneasy. When I came out to see Master being harassed, I couldn’t help myself…”

Yan Hanying knew that his hands were always clean; he had never stained them with blood or seen any blood.

He knew Jiang Jintang wasn't as naive and innocent as he thought, but this emotion didn't seem feigned; perhaps she was genuinely afraid.

Yan Hanying's lips moved slightly. Prince Shangjing's gaze was still intensely fixed on him, but he completely ignored it, looking only at Jiang Jintang before him and asking, "Who died?"

"I don't know, it seems to have been a servant."

There was only one servant in the Red Gate Hall, Xu Yingchun's guard.

Yan Hanying had long expected him to die young, but he hadn't expected him to die so soon. So he casually offered a few words of comfort, saying, "Just a servant. Since it's already been dealt with, don't think about it anymore."

He then protectively stepped in front of Jiang Jintang, meeting Prince Shangjing's gaze.

Prince Shangjing ignored him, his gaze fixed on the young man behind him, as if investigating something, his expression slightly serious.

Yan Hanying was somewhat displeased, feeling as if his possession had been spied on. He coldly drew the other's attention back, "Your Highness, if there's nothing else, you may leave. As for Mu Chen, I will release him once the truth is revealed. If he tries to harm my disciple, I will take his life immediately."

He uttered these harsh words, then looked away from Prince Shangjing and entered the Red Gate Hall.

Jiang Jintang hurriedly followed, ordering someone to close the door, blocking Prince Shangjing's view.

Yan Hanying walked towards the dungeon, lost in thought. Halfway there, he snapped out of it and, hearing Jiang Jintang's footsteps following closely behind, couldn't help but stop and ask, "Weren't you scared? Why did you follow me again?"

"Master is coming to interrogate Mu Chen. Since this matter started because of me, I should go and see."

Yan Hanying remained silent for a long time. Jiang Jintang carefully observed his expression by the light of the wall lamp. After a long while, Yan Hanying finally said, "I'm so scared I can't sleep tonight."

Jiang Jintang then smiled. "We can talk about tonight."

He seemed somewhat elated and quickly followed Yan Hanying's steps, all the way to the depths of the dungeon.

Jiang Jintang's smile faded, and a coldness appeared in her eyes.

That damned guard died here. Jiang Jintang knew that as Yan Hanying's apprentice, he understood that Yan Hanying had made many enemies in court. Those people, unable to harm Yan Hanying, often reached out to him, thinking that his death would strike a blow against Yan Hanying.

Jiang Jintang only felt that Yan Hanying was cold-hearted and ungrateful. Although outsiders said so, he believed it to be true.

A eunuch who had never studied, yet had risen to his current position through his own means, was certainly not a hesitant person.

Perhaps even if he died, Yan Hanying wouldn't care too much; at most, he would feel a pang of regret.

Jiang Jintang was lost in thought when Yan Hanying's hand warmer fell. He walked a short distance back, his palms and fingers already icy cold.

He gently breathed on his fingers, and a jailer pushed out a chair for him. Yan Hanying sat down calmly, his purple robes making his face appear even paler, and his sickly complexion made him look frail.

Despite this, no one dared to underestimate this high-ranking official.

Yan Hanying felt a dryness in his throat and coughed lightly. A servant outside the door whispered in his ear, "My lord, the Prince hasn't left yet."

"In this cold weather, if he wants to stand there, let him," Yan Hanying said, ignoring the Prince of Shangjing, "Bring Mu Chen here."

"He's here, my lord."

As soon as he finished speaking, several jailers carried in Mu Chen, covered in blood, and tied him to the rack.

This was a rule set by Yan Hanying herself: anyone who entered the Red Gate Hall, regardless of their crime, would first receive a lash, whether they were tough or soft-hearted; no one would show favoritism.

Having been tortured, Mu Chen was now almost dead. He only regained some consciousness after being splashed with cold water, and he glared hatefully at Yan Hanying.

Yan Hanying, holding her teacup, remained expressionless, not even glancing at him, only saying, "You seem to be in good spirits."

"Heh," Mu Chen's voice was hoarse, "If you want me dead, just do it directly. Why pretend?"

"I said I never uttered a single word about taking your life," Yan Hanying's eyelashes trembled slightly, and she raised her eyes slightly to look back at him, "You're nothing but the adopted son of Prince Shangjing. Prince Shangjing and his relatives and advisors wanted to make things difficult for me, so they called you some kind of marquis. In reality, you're a useless piece of trash with nothing. You have to beg several times just to get into the academy, so how could you possibly produce poison from the royal family?"

Yan Hanying had thoroughly investigated Mu Chen's background before she arrived. She knew exactly when he appeared in the capital and when he became Prince Shangjing's adopted son.

He didn't see the pale, stiff expression on Mu Chen's face, and continued, "You went to great lengths to enter the Prince's mansion and become his adopted son, only to end up as nothing more than an insignificant discarded pawn."

"Don't even think about sowing discord."

"Who cares about sowing discord between you?" Yan Hanying scoffed, then added, "You clearly had adoptive parents in Jiangnan, yet you abandoned them for wealth and power. Your adoptive father certainly thought things through, putting on a show of loyalty and righteousness in court. But if your heartless and ungrateful actions were to spread among the common people, even if Prince Shangjing wanted to seek justice for you, it would be extremely difficult."

After hearing his alarming words, Yan Hanying raised her hand to order the torture, but suddenly remembered that Jiang Jintang was still standing behind her.

At this moment, he finally remembered that he still needed to improve Jiang Jintang's favorability. He usually deliberately avoided Jiang Jintang when doing bad things; he knew he wasn't a good person, yet he had never been seen handling a criminal, and even so, Jiang Jintang's favorability was so difficult to raise. He couldn't let Jiang Jintang see his bad side.

Yan Hanying hesitated, pondered for a moment, then stood up and leisurely walked to Mu Chen. He lifted Mu Chen's drooping chin and said in a low voice, "Who is Prince Shangjing? Do you really think he's so kind to you? It's laughable. Once interests are involved, you'll be the first person he abandons, and he might even try to eliminate you completely. You should be glad I didn't hand you over to the Ministry of Justice. In my hands, I can let you live a few more days."

He met Mu Chen's gaze, the young man's eyes filled with an unreadable emotion, perhaps hatred.

Yan Hanying felt it was normal; how many people in this world didn't hate him?

He tightened his grip, pinching Mu Chen's chin painfully, then pushed him away.

Yan Hanying coughed twice, then said, "Press it down."

Passing Jiang Jintang, he seemed somewhat uneasy, saying, "Let's go back to the manor."

"Yes, Master."

Jiang Jintang obediently followed him outside. After walking a long way, Jiang Jintang couldn't help but ask, "Master... why didn't you torture him today?"

Yan Hanying frowned.

Jiang Jintang really wanted to see him torture someone? Was he trying to lecture law enforcement?

He hesitated for a moment, then lied, "I'm in a good mood today. Torture him... let's do it another day."

The young man behind him fell silent again.

They left the Red Gate Hall. Yan Hanying looked around, but didn't see Prince Shangjing; it seemed he had already left.

Yan Hanying then got into the carriage. Seeing the heavy snow, he asked Jiang Jintang to come along.

Jiang Jintang sat obediently beside him.

Yan Hanying hugged the soft cushion, closing his eyes wearily, yet he felt Jiang Jintang's presence was too overwhelming; even her soft breathing made him feel irritated.

Yan Hanying drifted off into thought, realizing that it was still because of the script and the system, he was now actually starting to dislike Jiang Jintang.

That was clearly the child he used to love most.
