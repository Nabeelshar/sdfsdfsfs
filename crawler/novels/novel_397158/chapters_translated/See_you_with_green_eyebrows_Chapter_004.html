Chapter 4 04 Go Buy Me a Coffin

Jiang Jintang did everything meticulously, putting on his shoes and socks, warming water, and handing it to Yan Hanying.

Yan Hanying sat on pins and needles in his chair, feeling as if he couldn't wake from a nightmare. Seeing Jiang Jintang respectfully hand him the cup, he didn't reach out to take it, remaining stiff.

Jiang Jintang frowned slightly, a hint of doubt in his heart.

He said, "Master, have some water. Are you still terrified? I'll go call a doctor to examine you."

Jiang Jintang had often heard of people falling seriously ill from nightmares; some recovered the next day, while others suffered fatal consequences.

For someone as wicked as Yan Hanying, whose hands were stained with countless lives and blood, it wasn't surprising that he dreamt of demons seeking revenge.

He felt a mixture of satisfaction and a bitter, unsettling feeling, like eating a sour date, unable to pinpoint the source of this sensation. He concluded that Yan Hanying's methods were simply too cruel.

That night, he secretly went to the dungeon and saw the guard, barely recognizable as human. Upon learning he was Xu Yingchun's guard, Yan Hanying had overstepped his bounds, arresting him without even informing Xu Yingchun, and then swiftly beating him to this state.

They claimed to have used torture to extract a confession, and the evidence was irrefutable, yet the man's elder brother was still left half-dead, barely clinging to life with medicine. He wouldn't survive the harsh winter and would likely die within days.

Furthermore, they heard that Yan Hanying wasn't satisfied and planned to torture him again during the day.

Jiang Jintang knew that Yan Hanying was humiliating the young guard because of him, and he couldn't decide whether to approve or disapprove. Seeing that Yan Hanying was deliberately concealing his true feelings, he didn't say anything more and advised him to stop.

If Yan Hanying wanted to vent his anger this way, he would let him, but he couldn't bear to watch such nightmares unfold.

Seeing that Yan Hanying was still lost in thought, and the room was dark with no lights on, he picked up the lantern that had fallen to the floor and placed it on the table.

The warm yellow light illuminated Yan Hanying's face, still pale and dazed.

Jiang Jintang had no choice but to put down his cup and said, "I'll go fetch the doctor."

Yan Hanying couldn't wait for him to leave so she could calm down.

He couldn't help but urge, "Go quickly."

He finally saw Jiang Jintang to the door and slammed the door shut.

The room quieted down. Yan Hanying stood at the door, lost in thought, and it took her a while to come back to her senses. Her first thought was that Jiang Jintang had forgotten to take the lantern with him, and hadn't brought an umbrella either.

He thought for a moment, then, somewhat dazed, squatted down, hugging his knees in bewilderment, and asked, "Am I dreaming?"

"Ahhh," the system continued flipping through the script, "you're a vicious cannon fodder character. You adopted the villain, bullied him from a young age, deprived him of clothes, food, and sleep, so he harbored a deep hatred for you. When you grew up, he stabbed you to death with a sword and had a Taoist priest seal you in a coffin! Ahhhhh, what kind of plot is this?!"

Upon hearing this, Yan Hanying's face paled again, and he said agitatedly, "Shut up!"

He seemed somewhat angry. The system, which had initially thought him to be quite good-natured, suddenly saw his usual vicious and sinister side and immediately fell silent.

Yan Hanying gasped for breath, then chuckled softly after a moment, a smile tinged with a sinister edge. "If I kill him now, and then try to gain favor with the protagonist, everything can be back on track, right?"

He was a man of action, and as he stood up, the light and shadow cast a shadow on his face, making his seemingly gentle and relaxed smile appear exceptionally sinister.

The system shuddered. As Yan Hanying frantically searched for her sword, the system finally cried out again, "Stop, host! He's a key figure; he can't die yet! You can't kill him now!"

"If I don't kill him now, he'll be the one killing me later!" Yan Hanying gritted her teeth, her hand gripping the sword trembling uncontrollably. "It's all your fault! If you hadn't mysteriously disappeared five years ago, how could I have raised the wrong person? After I kill Jiang Jintang, I'll rip you out of my brain and chop you into eight pieces!"

The system was terrified.

After a brief silence, Yan Hanying had already drawn her sword and gone outside, walking into the courtyard against the wind and snow.

The system first squeaked and screamed, then disappeared briefly.

As Yan Hanying reached the courtyard gate, a wolfhound suddenly grabbed his clothes, blocking his path.

The dog wailed, "Host, master, husband, father! If you kill him, we're all doomed! Nobody will survive, and..."

The dog started looking for "and."

After a while, it said, "If you fail to kill him, then you'll really be dead, boohoo! Look how well you've raised him! He's so obedient, and you haven't mistreated him all these years, have you?"

Yan Hanying's emotions slowly calmed down.

As he calmed down, he realized it seemed true. He was a model young man with a higher education in modern times, and he even had a teacher's license. He had indeed been strict with Jiang Jintang's upbringing for the past five years, but he hadn't mistreated her.

Besides, Jiang Jintang is now a grown man, and if he were to attempt an assassination, he might not escape unscathed.

Yan Hanying was completely calm, and completely broken.

Keeping Jiang Jintang by her side was always a threat. He was so hypocritical, so deceitful, always smiling, yet his popularity was plummeting. Who knew when he might impulsively decide to kill her at the slightest provocation?

The sword clattered into the snow. Yan Hanying stood forlornly in the snow. The snowstorm tonight reminded him so much of the scene of his death in his memory, as if hinting that his time was drawing near.

If she counted carefully, according to the plot, it seemed she only had two years left.

Yan Hanying felt dizzy and lightheaded. He was doing well as a teacher in the modern world; with a few more years of hard work, he could have become a top-notch educator. Why did he have to be transmigrated here?

If he could do it all over again, he would definitely protect his body.

And his hair.

He would never stay up late again.

These were Yan Hanying's last thoughts before losing consciousness.

The next day, the wind and snow subsided, and a sliver of sunlight peeked through the clouds, casting a meager glow that offered little warmth.

When Yan Hanying awoke, he was lying on the couch. The familiar person stood beside him, always carrying the rich fragrance of winter plum blossoms, which Yan Hanying could smell whenever he was near.

Just waking from a nightmare, he'd had a jumble of dreams, all of which he'd forgotten upon waking. He was still somewhat dazed, and before he could recall yesterday, he instinctively whispered, "Jin Tang..."

Only after speaking did he realize his voice had become hoarse and unpleasant overnight.

Yan Hanying's lips trembled, his head throbbing. Just as he was about to get up, Jiang Jin Tang came to his aid and helped him up.

"Master," Jiang Jin Tang whispered, "why are you so ill?"

[Affection +1, current affection 43]

Yan Hanying subconsciously thought, "Affection has actually increased."

Soon, his eyelashes trembled as he regained consciousness.

He'd raised the wrong person.

This one he raised wasn't the protagonist.

It was the villain.

It was that villain who was going to kill him with a single sword strike in two years.

Yan Hanying's eyes met Jiang Jintang's. Jiang Jintang's clear, glass-like eyes reflected his own pale, sickly face. Yan Hanying's vision blurred again, and he nearly collapsed.

Jiang Jintang quickly steadied him. "The doctor said Master was disturbed by a nightmare last night. He was already suffering from a cold, and then developed a high fever."

After a pause, he asked, "How did Master end up in the courtyard again? He collapsed in the snow, and no one found him. Luckily, a wolfhound was barking beside him."

Yan Hanying had a headache. Jiang Jintang rambled on, but he didn't hear a word. He only heard the system constantly reporting the favorability rating.

[Favorability -1, Current Favorability 42]

[Favorability -1, Current Favorability 41]

[Favorability -1, Current Favorability 40]

Don't let it drop any further.

Yan Hanying was on the verge of collapse, but utterly powerless to stop it. Only when the favorability dropped to thirty-five, and Jiang Jintang got up and went outside, did he finally calm down.

Yan Hanying finally released the pent-up anger in his chest. He leaned over the bed, coughing. Yue Jiao brought him water, and Yan Hanying hoarsely instructed her, "Go to the storeroom and get some silver. Go to the coffin shop."

"What does Master need to do at the coffin shop?"

"Go..." Yan Hanying gasped for breath, speaking softly yet firmly, "Go buy me a coffin."
