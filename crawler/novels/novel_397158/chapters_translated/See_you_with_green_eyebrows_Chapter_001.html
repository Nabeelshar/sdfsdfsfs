Chapter 1 01 It's Your Turn to Teach Me a Lesson

"Crack—"

The sound of a long whip striking a body pierced the air, echoing down the long prison corridor.

The groans, curses, and pleas for mercy of the prisoners could be faintly heard from within the cell.

But the person being executed seemed already lifeless, his head drooping, unmoved by the whipping.

The jailer, having lashed out with his whip, lowered it, spat again at the mangled mass of flesh on the rack, then turned, a fawning smile returning to his face. He cautiously spoke to the young man seated in a mahogany armchair nearby, "My lord, that little guard looks like he's about to die. The interrogation may have to end here today—"

"Have someone bring two basins of cold water," the young man said with a half-smile, "to splash him awake."

The young man wore a magnificent purple robe, a soft fox fur collar around his neck, and a jade crown binding his black hair. His smile was captivating, yet his rarely deep laughter made him appear hypocritical and cold-hearted.

Perhaps due to a cold, he was ill; his face was pale, as white as a finely carved porcelain figure.

Two long, slender, pale fingers tapped lightly on the table. After a long silence, he asked coldly, "What are you standing there for?"

"Yes, yes," the jailer quickly replied, "This servant will go right away."

He hurried along, just lifting the basin of water, when he saw the jailer's attendant enter the interrogation room and whisper in the jailer's ear, "Young Master Tang has returned from the temple and is on his way home."

Upon hearing this, Yan Hanying's smile froze, and he couldn't help but panic. He coughed twice quickly before saying, "Quickly come back with me to change your clothes and get rid of the blood smell."

He had come without warning and left in a hurry. In the blink of an eye, the cell was quiet again, with only the breathing of a few jailers audible.

Looking closer, the jailer saw that Yan Hanying was already far away. He then said, "Bah! A power-hungry eunuch, so ruthless! This prisoner is suffering, how did he end up in his hands?"

"Shh, don't let outsiders hear this, or you'll be tied up here tomorrow too."

*
Yan Hanying was completely unaware of the gossip. In the deep snow of winter in the capital, he braved the wind and snow to hurry back to his residence to wash away the bloodstains and then perfumed his cuffs and collar.

Just as Fang was dressed neatly, a servant outside the door suddenly said, "Young Master is back."

"Hmm," the young man's voice still carried a hint of its former clarity, asking gently, "Is Master inside?"

"Master was taking a bath."

Yan Hanying hastily abandoned her disheveled hair bun, letting her long, black hair fall obediently down her back. She could only hastily tie it up with a hair tie before Jiang Jintang entered the room.

Jiang Jintang knocked politely on the door. "Master, may I come in?"

Yan Hanying breathed a sigh of relief. "Yes."

"Creak—" The door opened slightly. Yan Hanying saw Jiang Jintang, travel-worn and covered in snow. For a moment, he forgot to ask why he had rushed back. He patted the snow off Jiang Jintang's shoulder with concern, saying, "Why aren't you wearing a cloak? Where's the carriage? Be careful not to catch a cold from the snow."

Just as he patted his chest, Jiang Jintang suddenly grabbed his fingers.

The young man, just past his twenties, was in good health. Although he was soaked in snow, his palms were warm, making Yan Hanying's fingers seem rather cold.

Jiang Jintang said, "Jintang is strong and healthy; Master, please be careful not to catch a chill."

With that, he even reached out and touched Yan Hanying's forehead without any regard for propriety.

Yan Hanying was startled to find that the boy was already taller than her, and didn't have time to dodge.

They ate the same things every day in the manor; was this the protagonist's halo?

Just as she was lost in thought, Jiang Jintang said again, "I heard at the temple that Master was ill, so I couldn't concentrate on worshiping Buddha and rushed back. Have you taken your medicine? Why are your hands still a little hot?"

He rattled off a bunch of questions, not seeming to be waiting for Yan Hanying's response, and then turned and called out, "Yuejiao!"

[Favorability +1, Current Favorability 46]

Yan Hanying clicked her tongue inwardly.

More than five years have passed since he transmigrated here, and he's raised Jiang Jintang for five years, witnessing him grow from a shy and obedient fifteen-year-old into this handsome and refined young man. Yet, he still can't understand the source of Jiang Jintang's increasing affection for him.

It always inexplicably increases or decreases a little, and after five years, it hasn't broken fifty.

Yuejiao had already entered the room and asked, "What is it, young master?"

"Did you give Master his medicine today?"

"Yes, he did."

"If it's not very effective, have another doctor come back to take a look. Master is weak; he's always sick for a long time. If it drags on, his health will deteriorate."

"Don't worry too much," Yan Hanying sometimes thought, the protagonist is indeed the protagonist—polite, emotionally stable, and very caring. "He's much better now."

After saying that, she pretended to be stern and scolded him a couple more times, "I told you to go listen to the sutras with your classmates, but instead, you found an excuse to run home."

"Master..."

[Favorability +1, Current Favorability 47]

Yan Hanying paused, looking at the doctor before her. The young man, head bowed and smiling as he accepted the scolding, tentatively added, "Look at other people's children, they don't give up halfway."

[Favorability -1, Current Favorability 46]

Yan Hanying: "..."

The young man was still saying he would definitely change, but Yan Hanying was a little unsure and said again, "I didn't mean to compare you to other children."

[Favorability -1, Current Favorability 45]

"I'm just worried that if you keep running home every time something happens, you'll become unsociable in the long run."

[Favorability -1, Current Favorability 44]

Yan Hanying took a deep breath: "...What if you get bullied in the future..."

The system stopped broadcasting automatically.

Yan Hanying slowly swallowed the breath, but halfway down, the system suddenly beeped again:

"Affection -2, Current Affection 42"

Yan Hanying coughed violently, uncontrollably, her throat filled with the metallic taste of blood, a heart-wrenching cough as if she were about to vomit her heart and lungs out.

Her pale face, due to the cold, flushed red, and her lips became an unusually bright red, as if adorned with lip rouge.

He was momentarily out of breath. Seeing his severe coughing and the blood on his hands, Jiang Jintang was anxious. She gently patted his back, helped him sit on the couch, and softly asked, "Master, your cough hasn't fully healed. Even after coughing up blood, is there anything else that's bothering you?"

Yan Hanying was panting. The warmth of Jiang Jintang's palm, felt on his back from her touch, slowly spread throughout his body, easing his slightly stiff pulse.

Yan Hanying then heard the system automatically announce:

"Affection +5, current affection 47"

Yan Hanying: "..."

Are you crazy? "Master is right," Jiang Jintang obediently admitted his mistake, saying, "I won't disobey Master's wishes again. Please don't be angry, Master, and don't let me upset you."

He patted Yan Hanying's back, fed him water, and seemed completely concerned only about his health, rambling on and on about how to make sure Yan Hanying took his medicine and rested properly, not to worry about politics all the time.

He was always obedient and compliant in front of Yan Hanying, his word was his bond, and Yan Hanying usually didn't need to worry about him too much.

Jiang Jintang's concern pleased Yan Hanying. He thought the boy was sensible, but perhaps because he was over twenty, approaching adulthood, and had become more worldly and knowledgeable, he seemed to have his own ideas and plans. Lately, Yan Hanying felt he had become somewhat rebellious and less obedient.

He feigned anger, saying, "Who are you to lecture me?"

"How dare Jintang lecture his master?" Jiang Jintang smiled, seemingly unconcerned by Yan Hanying's words, and got up to tidy up the papers and writing materials scattered on the table.

Yan Hanying watched with a worried expression as Jiang Jintang cleaned up the mess he had made.

Five years ago, he had just started teaching math at a high school. He died from overwork while preparing lessons before even finishing his first semester. He woke up here, as the same person with the same name and appearance as the Grand Secretary.

While time travel is rare, he had heard of it in online novels and TV dramas, so it wasn't too hard to accept when it happened to him. He even quickly adapted to his new identity.

He was the Grand Secretary of the Great Ning Dynasty. But the title of Grand Secretary was merely that of a power-hungry eunuch. Rumor had it that he was ignorant and illiterate, yet he held the emperor hostage, wielding absolute power over the young emperor. His methods were exceptionally cruel; he was a treacherous and wicked villain.

However, the rumors didn't seem entirely accurate. Yan Hanying had seen letters left by the original owner of this body in his room. These were letters addressed to current officials or students who hadn't yet taken the imperial examinations. The handwriting was beautiful and the words were sincere, indicating he wasn't unskilled in writing.

Furthermore, he was a fake eunuch.

When Yan Hanying first arrived, he actually had a system with him, which gave him an original work.

The original work resembled a hastily written outline, without titles, only a few pronouns.

The creature he adopted in the book wasn't the protagonist, but rather the biggest and most evil villain in the entire story. Perhaps because he mistreated the villain, or for other reasons, the villain, after growing up, killed Yan Hanying with a sword and cursed him, sealing his coffin in a tomb.

The system only told Yan Hanying to find and adopt the protagonist, while simultaneously increasing the protagonist's favorability. Yan Hanying was initially relieved that he wouldn't have to deal with the so-called villain again. However, the system disappeared without revealing who the protagonist and villain were.

Yan Hanying searched for many days and finally found Jiang Jintang at the Capital Academy. She was the most obedient and well-behaved child in the academy, exceptionally intelligent, but orphaned and homeless for many years. She was only able to attend the academy thanks to the teacher's support.

Yan Hanying felt he hadn't made a mistake. He took the child home for five years, and indeed, as he had expected, Jiang Jintang was truly well-behaved and rarely made mistakes.

It was nothing more than the occasional slip-up in the academy's quizzes, where he'd come in second place, but Yan Hanying would personally tutor him through the night until he reached first place.

Yan Hanying's biggest headache was still Jiang Jintang's favorability rating. He racked his brains trying to understand why Jiang Jintang, who was clearly so dependent on him, had seen his favorability rating skyrocket in the first year, only to stagnate afterwards.

Could it be that his past obedience was all an act?

Yan Hanying pondered for a moment, then decided it was impossible.

How could the protagonist do such a thing?

He banished these thoughts. Jiang Jintang had already gone to the east kitchen to fetch new medicine and brought it back to Yan Hanying.

The snow had deepened, the medicine was steaming hot, a cloud of white vapor rising to the surface, the room filled with the bitter smell of herbs.

Yan Hanying disliked bitter tastes, but his cold was making him feel unwell, so he took the medicine bowl and drank it all in one gulp.

Jiang Jintang, like coaxing a child, took out a piece of malt candy and handed it to Yan Hanying, saying, "When I was seriously ill as a child, Master would coax me to take my medicine like this."

"Why are you suddenly reminiscing about the past?" Yan Hanying took the candy from his palm and put it in his mouth.

Before he could put his hand down, Jiang Jintang suddenly grabbed it.

"Hmm?"

"Master changed the incense," Jiang Jintang's still somewhat youthful and handsome face showed a hint of doubt, "Has the calming incense that I asked someone to bring back from the water town last month been used up?"

Yan Hanying subconsciously felt a little guilty, glancing at the corner of the table. There was still half a box of calming incense in the gold-threaded wooden box; he had opened a new box today because he was in a hurry to burn incense. “It seems to have been a gift from one of my advisors—”

“It smells quite nice,” Jiang Jintang interrupted, narrowing her eyes. “It seems that Master’s colleagues are the ones who truly understand his likes and dislikes.”

Yan Hanying felt that these words didn’t sound very pleasant and was about to speak when Jiang Jintang suddenly added, “However… the bloody smell is a bit overwhelming.”
