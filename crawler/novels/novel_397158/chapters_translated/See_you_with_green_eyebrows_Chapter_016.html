Chapter 16 16 Why Can't You Just Be Obedient?

Jiang Jintang's face went blank for a moment, as if he hadn't understood what Yan Hanying had just said.

He stammered, "Master..."

Yan Hanying realized he had spoken without thinking, and his lower back bumped against the table, causing it to tilt slightly.

The continuously decreasing favorability rating reminded him that Jiang Jintang's favorability had dropped by five points because of his words.

Why, why? Yan Hanying was in a state of turmoil. Seeing Jiang Jintang turn his gaze away to the whip beside him, Yan Hanying felt a chill run down her spine. She abruptly kicked the whip away, feigning anger, and said, "I told you to go back to the manor to study! What are you doing here? There are servants in the manor; why did you have to run around like this?"

Jiang Jintang's tail, which was barely visible behind him, seemed to droop. He looked somewhat aggrieved, but didn't fully reveal it. He only apologized to Yan Hanying, "I'm sorry to disappoint Master. It won't happen again."

He seemed genuinely apologetic, but Yan Hanying's heart was still pounding. She thought he was being hypocritical; his outward appearance was so obedient, but in reality, his goodwill towards him was plummeting.

This time, Yan Hanying was truly determined to complete the mission. At the very least, he needed to get his hands on the kidney-tonifying pills. His plan to feign death and leave the capital seemed to need to be put on the agenda; he couldn't just sit and wait to die.

He was lost in thought. Jiang Jintang, unaware of his thoughts, simply handed him the fox fur coat, saying, "After delivering the coat, I'll head back."

"Hmm," Yan Hanying replied absentmindedly, "I...I didn't mean to criticize you."

Perhaps it was a recurrence of his old professional habits; he placed great importance on Jiang Jintang's studies, even overriding his fear that Jiang Jintang might one day betray him. His mind was completely focused on Jiang Jintang's future career.

Sometimes, being too concerned led to being exceptionally strict with Jiang Jintang, to the point of neglecting the child's normal development.

He used to think Jiang Jintang was obedient, sensible, and understood his good intentions, but now he realized it was all an act.

If she could keep up the act forever, that would be one thing, but it only lasted a few years. Once she gained power, she started plotting revenge against society.

This was unacceptable.

Yan Hanying's mind was in turmoil. Jiang Jintang seemed to have said something to him, but he didn't listen carefully. He simply led Jiang Jintang out of the dungeon.

Jiang Jintang followed Yan Hanying at a distance, and before leaving the interrogation room, she secretly turned her head to look at Mu Chen, who was tied to the rack.

Mu Chen was on the verge of death, but still looked up. Their eyes met, and Jiang Jintang saw the disdain and provocation in his eyes. Her face instantly turned cold, and she turned and walked away.

He followed Yan Hanying into the corridor. Yan Hanying's cough hadn't fully subsided; she coughed twice more after inhaling the cold wind before her expression softened. She said, "I know your good intentions. Coming to deliver the fox fur coat to your master is for his own good. However, you can't always focus on other things. The provincial examination is approaching; you must prepare. If you fail the palace examination, no matter how powerful I am, I'll be nothing more than a rebellious traitor overstepping my authority. If I protect you and help you rise to power, and then I lose power, you will be implicated as well."

"Master," Jiang Jintang finally spoke, as if unable to hold back any longer, "why must I enter the court as an official?"

Yan Hanying's unfinished words caught in her throat; she didn't know how to answer Jiang Jintang tonight.

"You chose me from among the many at the academy, brought me back to your residence for my upbringing, didn't you say it was simply to make my future more comfortable?"

Yan Hanying was speechless.

That was his initial plan. He thought Jiang Jintang was the protagonist, firmly believing that protagonists have a protagonist's halo and will have a good future.

After Jiang Jintang's first quiz at the academy, he relapsed into his old habit, single-mindedly wanting Jiang Jintang to be the top student, placing all his unfulfilled ambitions and ideals from the court onto Jiang Jintang.

If Jiang Jintang hadn't brought it up now, he wouldn't have realized when he became so fixated on having Jiang Jintang enter the court as an official.

Thinking about it carefully, he seemed to have even considered having Jiang Jintang strive for higher power.

Such a thought was truly rebellious, or perhaps because he knew it would be incredibly difficult to achieve, he himself had never firmly held onto this idea.

He felt a little flustered, knowing in his heart that he shouldn't be pressuring Jiang Jintang like this. Moreover, things were now clear: Jiang Jintang wasn't the protagonist, but the antagonist. If he continued to push him, one day Jiang Jintang would completely resent him, perhaps following the same path as in the original story.

Yan Hanying thought this, yet he couldn't help wondering why Jiang Jintang couldn't listen to him.

With power in his hands, he had the ability to stand alone; from now on, no one would bully him, and no one would look down on him.

His emotions were complex. Suddenly, he heard Jiang Jintang soften her voice, saying, "I misspoke, Master. I didn't mean to disobey you. I will continue to prepare diligently for the imperial examination."

[Favorability -1, Current Favorability 38]

Yan Hanying closed his eyes, anxious. "Let's not talk about this now. Go back to the manor."

His mind was in turmoil. He no longer knew how to discipline Jiang Jintang. Because of the so-called plot, he felt stifled, having to observe Jiang Jintang's attitude in everything he did, unlike his usual carefree self.

His mood fluctuated constantly with Jiang Jintang's favorability level. He didn't know if Jiang Jintang hated him, but now he was the one who resented her first.

Why couldn't she just be more obedient?

Yan Hanying's chest heaved as he forced down his dark thoughts. He felt as if he had been provoked by Mu Chen, and his mental state was somewhat off; now didn't seem like the time to discuss serious matters.

He took Jiang Jintang back to the mansion by carriage. Just as they entered the hanging flower gate, Yan Hanying suddenly stopped and told Jiang Jintang to go to another courtyard and not follow him into the inner chambers.

Jiang Jintang seemed somewhat at a loss, cautiously asking, "Is Master still angry with me? I can change, I promise I won't do it again next time."

"No," Yan Hanying said, a headache forming in his head. He didn't have the energy to argue with Jiang Jintang, simply saying, "Go back to your room first. You don't need to wait for me for dinner."

After a pause, he seemed to relent, saying, "If you don't want to study, take a day off. Anyway… anyway, there's no rush."

With that, he ignored Jiang Jintang behind him, returning directly to his courtyard, closing the door tightly, and lying listlessly on the couch.

His favorability rating had been steadily declining. Actually, in the previous five years, it had only increased more slowly, but there had never been such a large-scale drop in favorability.

It seemed he realized he'd approached the wrong person. Knowing Jiang Jintang wasn't the villain, his affection for her steadily declined, influenced by his outwardly expressed emotions.

Was his own emotion really that obvious? Was Jiang Jintang truly so attentive to his feelings and attitude?

had he neglected her before?

Yan Hanying began to reminisce about the past. The year Jiang Jintang returned to the manor, she suddenly developed a high fever and was bedridden for half a month. During that time, he had been by her side, caring for her constantly. After recovering, Jiang Jintang was very clingy to him for a while, but at that time, he was embroiled in a power struggle with the Empress Dowager, and he hadn't returned to the manor for a long time, constantly navigating the palace. He had even been punished for making a wrong move, and only returned home after recovering from his injuries for several days.

Later, the conflict escalated, and he had indeed neglected Jiang Jintang's needs. Whenever he returned home, he would only inquire about her studies, casually criticizing her if her grades slipped, and then secretly tutor her.

Jiang Jintang was obedient; he had never seen her go through a rebellious phase, and now, thinking about it, something seemed amiss.

Every child goes through a rebellious phase, and no matter how obedient Jiang Jintang was, she was bound to experience this period.

Yan Hanying began to ponder how to make up for the lost time he had spent with her.

He was lost in thought, not even noticing when Yue Jiao came in to offer him some calming incense. Already lacking appetite, he ate some fruit and then fell asleep on the table.

Yue Jiao wanted to wake him and help him to bed, but as soon as she entered the room, someone grabbed her wrist from behind.

Jiang Jintang gently pulled her closer, whispering, "I'll go, you go and rest."

"Ah, yes, young master."

Yue Jiao didn't suspect her young master's intentions and turned to leave.

Jiang Jintang gently closed the door. The candlelight on the table flickered twice with the movement, casting a warm glow on Yan Hanying's sleeping face.

He was fast asleep, the shadow of his eyelashes falling beneath his eyes, soft as feathers. His cheeks and lips were rosy. Perhaps breathing heavily, Yan Hanying's mouth was slightly open, breathing softly.

Jiang Jintang seemed unable to contain his emotions. He leaned down and gently touched Yan Hanying's lips, then suddenly remembered his hands were covered in blood. He quickly turned away, went to the courtyard to wash his hands, and returned to the house, still cool and damp.

The calming incense was remarkably effective at inducing sleep, and Yan Hanying fell into a deep, unawakened sleep, as if Jiang Jintang could do whatever he wanted to him.

But Jiang Jintang didn't overstep his bounds again, only saying softly, "Why is it that whether I'm obedient or not, I can't touch Master's heart? There's an old saying, 'Those near the water get the moon first,' but in the end, I'm just letting others take advantage of me."
