Chapter 19 19 Confined to the House

"Why did my favorability rating suddenly increase again?" Yan Hanying couldn't figure it out, recalling Jiang Jintang's actions before leaving the manor earlier that day.

The closeness of their breaths and the warmth emanating from their bodies reminded Yan Hanying that Jiang Jintang was now a grown man. He was no longer the naive boy she remembered, doting on her. Now he had his own thoughts and plans, and had even gone to the Red Gate Hall behind her back.

The Jiang Jintang in the system's memories also had ambition. That sense of pressure was hard for Yan Hanying to ignore, like walking on a narrow bridge, hanging precariously above a cliff. One wrong step and he would fall, making him extremely uneasy.

Yan Hanying closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and forced herself to calm down.

The carriage arrived outside the palace. As usual, she entered amidst the veiled sarcasm and mockery of officials and ministers, first going to see the young emperor.

The young emperor was much more obedient today. When Yan Hanying arrived, he was already washing up, so she stood by the table for a while, casually flipping through the essays on the emperor's desk.

The young emperor looked somewhat nervous. As the palace maids dressed him, his gaze kept drifting towards Yan Hanying.

Yan Hanying casually said, "The handwriting is not bad."

Besides that, she offered no further comment.

The young emperor was momentarily disappointed. After a long pause, he finally couldn't help but ask, "Besides the calligraphy?"

"Your Majesty is still young and has spent many years in the palace. You haven't experienced the hardships of the common people and haven't seen much of the world. Most of your policy essays are rigid clichés drawing on the past to illuminate the present, lacking any personal insight. I have no words of praise for such essays."

He was honest, and the young emperor knew his writing wasn't particularly good, but he felt truly wronged.

He had only wanted a word of praise, whether sincere or feigned, nothing more.

But Yan Hanying had acted like a treacherous minister, yet before him he appeared steadfast and unyielding—utterly hypocritical.

Yan Hanying was always strict when teaching him, and as he grew older, he became somewhat annoyed and no longer wanted to be controlled by her.

The two went to the Taihe Hall together, Yan Hanying still thinking about Mu Chen's sister.

Mu Chen's sister wasn't his biological sister; she was an adopted daughter who had been sold into his family, presumably a child bride.

The protagonist's child bride—could she be the female lead?

If she really is the female lead, then it would explain why the system made him search for that child.

However, the character settings are so drastically different now, and the plot is so off-track, there's no chance for the male and female leads to develop a romantic relationship.

Yan Hanying was exhausted. Dealing with court affairs was already mentally draining enough; handling system tasks on top of that only added to his mental turmoil.

He sighed, then suddenly wondered, if that child were the female lead, could Jiang Jintang have also had feelings for her?

This thought had barely surfaced when Yan Hanying suddenly remembered Jiang Jintang from this morning.

Such a considerate yet subtly assertive personality, coupled with an alluring appearance, would likely easily make even someone other than the female lead fall for her at first sight.

But Yan Hanying still felt a tightness in his chest, for no apparent reason. After thinking for a long time, he realized it might be because the female lead was ultimately the male lead's lover, and he still didn't want to see Jiang Jintang hurt or sad.

"Master of the Seal," the young emperor called him for the third time, "are you listening to me?"

"Huh?" Yan Hanying suddenly snapped back to reality.

Just before regaining his senses, he was still thinking that this couldn't be a gay novel.

“Grandmother has been staying indoors lately,” the young emperor observed Yan Hanying’s expression, then continued, “She’s preparing for a fasting ceremony in the capital to pray for my cousin’s well-being, and she wants me to suspend court for a few days to join her in the Buddhist rituals.”

“Suspend court for what?” Yan Hanying said coldly, “How many times have I told you? Mu Chen is just a commoner from the countryside; what kind of cousin is he?”

She paused, then softened the coldness in her eyes and chuckled, “Eating vegetarian food and praying for a godson’s well-being—it’s truly laughable.”

Although she said this, Yan Hanying knew that the Empress Dowager and the others wanted to use public opinion to force her to release Mu Chen.

In truth, Yan Hanying hadn’t intended to kill Mu Chen while he was detained. The system had said that she should go all the way and kill Mu Chen directly.

But Yan Hanying still felt uneasy and hesitated to act, believing Mu Chen would still be useful to him.

Even if he was overthinking it, Mu Chen was already enough to threaten Prince Shangjing in the future.

If Prince Shangjing discarded this pawn, he would keep him for his own use.

Yan Hanying's plans were clear, but the pressure from public opinion and the worry about Jiang Jintang being implicated put him under considerable stress.

After attending court, the usual murmurs continued, but Yan Hanying was distracted and didn't pay much attention, only wanting to leave court as soon as possible.

His cold hadn't fully healed, and he felt exceptionally tired.

Yan Hanying, looking listless and lost in thought, suddenly heard Prince Shangjing call out to him, "Your Excellency, the Grand Secretary."

Yan Hanying lazily lifted his eyelids and looked over. His purple official robes accentuated his porcelain-white cheeks, which were flushed, and weariness clung to his brows and eyes, as if he were seriously ill.

King Shangjing's words caught in his throat, but he quickly recovered and said, "The Grand Secretary has been in power for many years, and his corruption, bribery, and seizure of land from ordinary people are no small matter. Now, he also holds the imperial treasury's seal; it's truly unsettling."

"If you're so worried, then stop focusing on the power I hold," Yan Hanying said without hesitation. He clearly knew he was a treacherous villain, deserving of being feared, and his misdeeds were undeniable; there was no arguing about it. "Out of sight, out of mind. As for whether he has done anything to harm the people, the people and my confidants know perfectly well."

King Shangjing knew Yan Hanying was sharp-tongued, but he never imagined he would dare say such things in front of so many officials and ministers in court. It was utterly arrogant.

Prince Shangjing was initially somewhat angry, but then he reconsidered. He realized that public opinion was difficult for Yan Hanying to control; rumors could be powerful, and even if they were false, widespread dissemination could confuse the public and cause them to lose faith in him.

If Yan Hanying was truly an ambitious person greedy for fame, fortune, and power, and wanted to seize imperial control, he would certainly need to protect his reputation.

Yan Hanying had already lost interest. Two hours had passed, and it was time to end the court session, so he urged the young emperor to speak.

The young emperor hesitated for a moment, then suddenly said, "Then... let Prince Shangjing and the Censorate re-examine the case of the young marquis poisoning his classmate."

Yan Hanying's eyes widened in surprise, "Your Majesty!"

"I heard that the Grand Secretary came in unwell," the young emperor's voice was still childish, but somehow he had memorized some rhetoric, and when he recited it, he sounded quite assertive and could even intimidate people, "In that case, I feel sorry for the Grand Secretary working so hard in court. Perhaps it would be better for him to return to his residence to recuperate, or stay in the palace and refuse visitors, until the truth is uncovered, so as to demonstrate justice."

With Yingzi confined to her quarters, Jin Tang will have to take the initiative (laughs)
