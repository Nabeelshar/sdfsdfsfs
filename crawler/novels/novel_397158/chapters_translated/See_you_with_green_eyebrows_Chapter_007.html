Chapter 7 07 One of These People is a Villain

Yan Hanying arrived at the academy just as the school was letting out.

This academy was established more than ten years ago at the city gate. Originally, it was simply a kind-hearted teacher who took in some homeless children and kindly taught them to read.

As they grew older, those who wanted to continue their studies in the imperial examinations stayed, while those who didn't want to study left to find suitable work.

Since the original owner took power, the number of students who passed the examinations at the academy increased daily. The original owner used to like to stroll around the academy, and after Yan Hanying transmigrated, she wanted to support it, investing a lot of money. First, she renovated the academy, then she replaced the desks and chairs, and in winter, fearing the students' hands would get cold, she secretly sent people to deliver charcoal braziers.

Knowing Yan Hanying's good intentions, the academy's teacher, Feng Liang, would sometimes chat with Jiang Jintang for a few days when Yan Hanying came to pick him up from school.

The academy was filled with students who had been preparing for the imperial examinations since childhood, along with a few children sent by aristocratic families; in recent years, the student body had indeed become somewhat mixed.

Yan Hanying stood outside the window, looking into the room. In the distance, she saw Jiang Jintang surrounded by several classmates, discussing something. Jiang Jintang's face was radiant with a gentle smile, truly like a spring breeze, like a green bamboo shoot, exceptionally eye-catching in his young age.

Yan Hanying was lost in thought for a moment, thinking that Jiang Jintang was indeed popular. No wonder he always received invitations from classmates over the years, even though Jiang Jintang had never accepted one because of his strict upbringing, yet he was still exceptionally warm towards him.

In his previous world, if he had gone to university, he would probably have been a heartthrob in the department.

While lost in thought, Yan Hanying suddenly heard a system announcement.

[Affection +2, Current Affection 38]

Yan Hanying was stunned, wondering, where did this increase in affection come from?

He really couldn't figure Jiang Jintang out. They had clearly grown up together, how could they have become so distant after only five years?

Yan Hanying sighed somewhat. The system hovered beside him, saying, "Host, you need to keep a close eye on them. One of these people is the villain."

"I know," Yan Hanying replied calmly.

The system, however, paused for a moment. "Eh, how did you know, host?"

"Of course I know. It's Jiang Jintang, isn't it?"

"..."
That makes sense.

The system stopped its foolish talk.

Students continued to emerge from the courtyard, chatting and laughing. They saw Yan Hanying standing outside the gate, wrapped in a fox fur coat and holding a hand warmer. Perhaps he was ill; his face was very pale, and his cheeks were flushed with a sickly redness. He looked frail yet gentle, accompanied by a fierce-looking wolfhound, who was absentmindedly looking towards the academy.

The young man in the white robe stared intently at him, unable to look away for a long time.

After a moment's hesitation, he turned to approach, intending to strike up a conversation, but his classmate quickly stopped him.

His classmate whispered, "Calm down. This isn't some courtesan you'd pick up at a brothel."

He leaned closer and whispered, "This is the Grand Master of the Palace. Don't let his god-like appearance fool you; he kills without batting an eye. Who knows how much human flesh that dog beside him has eaten?"

Hearing this, the young man became intimidated, abandoning his attempt to strike up a conversation and not moving forward.

Yan Hanying, oblivious, tugged at the fox fur wrapped around his neck, coughed lightly twice, and stepped over the threshold into the courtyard.

The academy was still filled with laughter and chatter. No one noticed Yan Hanying's arrival, or perhaps they didn't recognize him, or dared not utter a sound. They were unsure what mischief this unpredictable and treacherous minister was plotting this time, and even more afraid of the dog beside him.

Yan Hanying walked to the door. The wooden door was ajar. He pushed it open with a soft creak.

Jiang Jintang sat with his back to him at a table in the corner. Several young men of similar age were gathered around, chatting and laughing. Yan Hanying glanced at them one by one, recognizing a few of them. They were all children of high-ranking officials and nobles, offspring of his lackeys. They knew Jiang Jintang was his beloved disciple, whom he had raised with great care, and usually flattered him.

Besides…

Yan Hanying was thinking about the mistake of choosing the wrong protagonist again. He was always annoyed; back then, Jiang Jintang was the most handsome and well-behaved in the entire academy, and no one seemed more like a protagonist. If he was the villain, then who could be the protagonist?

His gaze shifted slightly. In the crowd, there was a simply dressed, ordinary-looking young man who looked like a commoner's child. Another, though adorned with gold and silver, was overweight, suggesting he ate lavish meals every day, perhaps from a wealthy merchant family.

And then there was another, standing opposite Jiang Jintang, handsome but with an arrogant air. Upon closer inspection, it became clear he was playing hand-to-hand combat with Jiang Jintang. Several other young men gathered to watch the spectacle.

Yan Hanying glanced at the young man a few more times, frowning slightly. She thought, if this person was the main character, it seemed like he and Jiang Jintang had picked up the wrong script.

The young men were engrossed in watching the game and didn't notice the person behind them.

Jiang Jintang held a black piece, a gentle smile on his face, yet the smile held a hint of coldness. He was focused intently on the chessboard.

The young man before her said softly, "I've blocked your last escape route. Trying to turn the tide on this chessboard is as impossible as ascending to heaven. You might as well admit defeat now."

He paused, then added, "Your master, seemingly powerful and influential, is actually just an illiterate eunuch. You claimed he taught you chess, but it seems his half-baked skills are only good enough for this. A paper tiger, utterly vulnerable."

Jiang Jintang remained silent, neither angry nor resentful. Her slender fingers gripped the chess pieces, her gaze scanning the board, searching for a way out.

The young man waited patiently, leaning back as he retrieved a food box from his desk, placed a plate of pastries on it, and beckoned to his classmates, "These were made by the chef at my godfather's house. Please help yourselves to whatever you like."

Just as he finished speaking, Jiang Jintang moved, about to place his piece, when a pale hand suddenly reached out from behind him, scooping up a black piece and placing it directly on the second rank.

Jiang Jintang froze, and the young man in front of him also seemed lost in thought.

Yan Hanying slowly straightened up, holding a hand warmer with a half-smile, and said, "Please continue."

Jiang Jintang stared blankly at Yan Hanying's profile, unable to react for a moment, not even recovering when Yan Hanying pushed him away from the table.

After a long pause, he watched as Yan Hanying leaned against the table, one leg propped on the chair, his ears slowly turning red.

The young man's expression changed abruptly; his previously arrogant demeanor vanished, and cold sweat beaded on his forehead.

Yan Hanying's move had ingeniously connected three lines of the chessboard, leaving no room for either passive play or aggressive attack.

He clutched his white piece for a long time, unable to place it.

Yan Hanying coughed lightly and chuckled, "What, where did you go?"

Silence fell around him; no one dared to speak to this legendary, seemingly ruthless master.

Yan Hanying, however, was domineering. He swept the chessboard away, scattering the pieces across the table, personally crushing the chessboard.

He coughed again, straightened up, and said, "Speak, what were you threatening Jin Tang about earlier?"

He was shorter than the young man in front of him, and although he tilted his head slightly, he seemed to be looking down at him as if he were in a superior position. He said, "If you tell the truth, I'll spare your life. After all, Jin Tang has a good temper and is easily bullied in the academy. As his teacher, I should stand up for him."

The young man still didn't answer, only lowered his head slightly, cold sweat dripping from his forehead.

Jiang Jintang, however, tugged at his sleeve and whispered, "Master, please don't be angry. Mu Chen was just playing chess with me. It's common for him to say harsh things during a game; it wasn't intentional."

He glanced to the side and added, "Look, he even brought me some homemade fillings."

As he spoke, Jiang Jintang reached for them, giving Mu Chen a gentle smile, as if to bury the hatchet.

Yan Hanying suddenly pressed down on the back of his hand.

"Since they were homemade, I'd like to try them."
