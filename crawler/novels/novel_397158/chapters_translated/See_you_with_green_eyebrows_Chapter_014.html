Chapter 14 14 I Don't Need Kidney Tonics

Yan Hanying's rapid heartbeat hadn't stopped; he just leaned back on the soft cushions, lost in thought.

He truly couldn't fathom Jiang Jintang's thoughts, and had already given up trying to find the source of her favorability rating, but every time the favorability rating announcement sounded, he couldn't help but feel a flutter in his heart, as if it were such a joyful thing.

Lost in thought, Yan Hanying soon saw Jiang Jintang reach the carriage. A servant placed a footstool for him, but he didn't get in. Standing on the footstool, he lifted the curtain slightly and asked, "Master, have you finished court?"

"Why are you out in this snow?" Yan Hanying replied, seemingly unrelated to the question. "Aren't you afraid of catching a cold?"

"I was wearing a cloak when I came out, so I didn't actually feel cold."

Yan Hanying thought that the child was still young and had a strong constitution, so he wasn't afraid of the cold.

His thoughts wandered, and he recalled that he himself hadn't had Jiang Jintang's good health as a child. He easily fell ill in winter, always needing to wear layers of thick clothing.

Even then, he couldn't avoid getting sick every winter.

Yan Hanying drifted off into thought again, and Jiang Jintang offered to explain, "My classmate told me this shop's sesame seed cakes are pretty good. I've been waiting here for days, but the owner never opened the door. Today, I heard that the owner went back from visiting relatives and reopened the shop, so I rushed out."

Yan Hanying, used to being a parent, instinctively scolded, "In this cold weather, you run out just for a little food? Why don't you stay home and kiss properly?" "Do you know the imperial examination is in March?"

"I know," Jiang Jintang seemed surprised by Yan Hanying's reprimand, wilting like a flower, his spirits waning. He only said softly, "I was just thinking... Master's appetite isn't good in winter; he only eats a little for lunch and dinner, so I thought I'd buy him two sesame cakes to satisfy his craving."

Yan Hanying's last sentence caught in his throat, unable to be uttered.

"You..." Yan Hanying murmured, "You bought them for me?"

"Yes." Jiang Jintang lowered his eyes. He didn't get into the carriage, but remained standing outside, simply handing over the steaming hot sesame cakes.

Yan Hanying was lost in thought and didn't reach out to take them.

Jiang Jintang, thinking he disliked it, bit her lower lip and proactively apologized, "If Master doesn't like it, I won't act on my own initiative anymore, and I'll stay in the manor to study diligently."

He made a move to take the sesame cake back, but Yan Hanying suddenly felt a pang of anxiety and quickly reached out, grabbing his wrist instead.

Having been exposed to the cold wind for a while, Jiang Jintang's wrists and fingers, exposed outside his sleeves, felt chilly, like a handful of snow.

Yan Hanying was startled by the icy touch and subconsciously pulled her hand away, but quickly gripped Jiang Jintang's wrist tightly again.

[Favorability +1, Current Favorability 50]

Over fifty?

Yan Hanying hesitated for a moment, then couldn't control herself and blurted out, "Since it's for me, how can I take it back?"

Jiang Jintang was also stunned for a second, then loosened his grip, letting Yan Hanying take the sesame cake.

After a while, a smile returned to his face. "Master, please try it while it's hot. If you like it, Jintang will come here again next time to wait for you after court to bring you some to tide you over. It'll save you from being too busy in court and then being late for your meal, which could upset your stomach."

"You...you shouldn't say that." Yan Hanying's ears burned. She thought to herself, how could she be so petty? Jiang Jintang was selling her sesame cakes in the cold weather, and all he could think about was criticizing her. He wasn't a very dutiful master.

He shifted his body to let Jiang Jintang into the carriage.

The young man, having stood in the wind and snow for so long, brought the chill and cold of the wind and snow with him as he sat beside Yan Hanying. He was still his usual gentle and kind self, yet Yan Hanying felt a sense of oppression, his whole body uncomfortable, even his back stiff.

He took a small bite of his sesame seed cake, then hesitantly looked up at Jiang Jintang, only to see her head bowed, adjusting her cloak placed beside her. The unsettling feeling of oppression vanished without a trace, as if he had been hallucinating.

Yan Hanying hesitated for a moment, then suddenly heard Jiang Jintang ask, "Master, is it good?"

He snapped out of his reverie, hastily nodded, and said, "It's alright."

This Jiang Jintang was still acting strangely; even his obedience seemed fake, yet Yan Hanying couldn't find anything amiss.

He took two more bites, then suddenly wondered why Jiang Jintang had suddenly brought him sesame cakes.

Could it be that she also wanted to poison the cakes like Mu Chen had?

Yan Hanying turned his gaze to the wolfhound lying beside him. The system seemed to be engrossed in its game, completely unresponsive to Yan Hanying's gaze.

Jiang Jintang noticed his gaze and said, "This dog insisted on coming with me today."

"Hmm," Yan Hanying replied somewhat guiltily, "This dog is somewhat intelligent."

As soon as he finished speaking, the dog, as if sensing someone was talking about it, suddenly raised its head.

Yan Hanying and the system stared at each other for a moment, wanting to ask what Jiang Jintang had been doing all day, but unfortunately, with a third person present, neither the system nor he could speak. They could only stare at each other blankly for a while.

The carriage stopped in front of the mansion gate. Jiang Jintang alighted first, then turned back to help Yan Hanying down, but Yan Hanying didn't extend his hand, only saying, "You go back first, I have other matters to attend to."

Jiang Jintang was taken aback. "Isn't Master going back to the mansion for dinner?"

"Perhaps," Yan Hanying replied vaguely, "We'll talk about it when I return."

Jiang Jintang had no choice but to lower the curtain, watching Yan Hanying's carriage depart with a mixture of grievance and reluctance.

Only when the carriage bells could no longer be heard did his expression slowly turn cold, completely unlike his usual obedient and gentle demeanor.

He stood outside the mansion for a while; the wind and snow started to pick up, and his shoes would get wet if he stayed any longer, before he finally turned and went back into the mansion.

“Prince Shangjing,” Jiang Jintang murmured, “Mu Chen, the Emperor… they’re all just people who like to seek validation from their master.”

He stayed in the manor for a while, and soon someone came to tell him that Yan Hanying had gone to the Red Gate Hall.

Now, only Mu Chen was in the Red Gate Hall. Jiang Jintang had clearly seen Mu Chen’s gaze; they all harbored the same feelings for Yan Hanying. He understood perfectly what some glances meant, and that made him uncomfortable.

What bothered him even more was that Mu Chen was already a prisoner, having suffered so much beating, yet he still dared to covet Yan Hanying.

If Mu Chen’s death weren’t detrimental to Yan Hanying, he would have loved to sneak into the Red Gate Hall at some opportunity and personally finish off that shameless scoundrel.

What a pity.

Jiang Jintang thought he needed to find other opportunities.

"Jingle bells—"

The string of small bells on the carriage jingled. Hearing the sound, the guards of the Red Gate Hall knew it was Yan Hanying and hurriedly came forward to greet him.

Yan Hanying leisurely alighted from the carriage and asked, "Is Mu Chen still alive?"

"Yes, sir."

"Don't use torture for the time being. If he's ill and near death, find a doctor to prolong his life."

The Prince Shangjing and the Empress Dowager were determined to oppose him. Holding him hostage would be beneficial; if he died, it would only bring them gossip and trouble.

After giving these instructions, Yan Hanying said he needed to go in and check on Mu Chen, and told everyone not to follow him.

After everyone left, he led the system towards the dungeon alone before asking, "What did you want to tell me?"

"Host, you have a mission," the system said. "Mu Chen has a two-year-old sister who is being fostered in the countryside."

Before he could finish, Yan Hanying interrupted, "I don't have the energy to raise another child."

"You must raise her," the system said. "That child is very important, and no one in the countryside is taking good care of her. She's about to die. You must bring her back to care for her."

"I won't get a reward for bringing her back," Yan Hanying said truthfully. Raising Jiang Jintang had already been very difficult for him. Now that he was over twenty-seven, perhaps due to overwork, his health seemed to be deteriorating. He would fall ill frequently, and when he was sick, it would last for many days. He truly didn't have the energy to raise another child. The system couldn't help but roll around at his feet, saying, "Host, just accept this mission. There's a reward... there is! Here's a Spring Night Tonic Pill."

"I don't need kidney tonics."

"This isn't a kidney tonic!" the system shouted. "The Spring Night Tonic Pill isn't for replenishing kidney deficiency. It's a pill that can temporarily enhance a person's physique. For example, if the host has to fake death and has to do a marathon-style escape, this Spring Night Tonic Pill can help the host replenish all the deficiencies in the body, helping the host successfully escape."

"Oh," Yan Hanying looked uninterested and casually asked, "What are the side effects?"
