Chapter 18 18 I just wanted to spend a little more time with you

Yan Hanying didn't feel comfortable asking Jiang Jintang about the system in front of him. He just thought to himself, with a mix of anxiety and uncertainty, that Jiang Jintang's previous increases in favorability ratings didn't seem to be related to these romantic affairs. Perhaps he was overthinking it.

What's the system doing, idly trying to matchmake a gay couple?

"Is Master going to court?" Jiang Jintang stepped forward, placing the medicine he was carrying on the table. "Master coughed and wheezed last night, so I went to the pharmacy and got two more doses of cough medicine. Master, please drink it before you go."

"Just leave it for now," Yan Hanying didn't like taking medicine, always finding it bitter. However, he wasn't the rebellious young man he once was, so he would only temporarily refuse, eventually drinking it obediently. "Where's Yuejiao?"

"I saw she was very tired, so I let her go back to her room to sleep," Jiang Jintang paused, as if hesitating, before finally saying, "What Yuejiao can do, I can do too."

"What are you saying?" Yan Hanying yawned lightly. "Yuejiao is a maid, you are the young master. Why should you do what a maid should do?"

Jiang Jintang was speechless for a moment.

Yan Hanying, still recovering from typhoid fever, had to rise early for court. Coupled with the heavy workload and immense pressure, he began to drowsy again as he sat in his chair. As he vaguely combed his hair, Jiang Jintang's warm hand suddenly grasped his wrist.

Yan Hanying looked up blankly, only to have Jiang Jintang take the comb away.

“It’s not that I’m taking over Yuejiao’s duties,” Jiang Jintang said softly, “I just feel that some small things are more appropriate for me to do since I’m closer to you, Master.”

He gently patted Yan Hanying’s head, helping him sit up straight, and carefully combed his hair. “Hair tying, dressing—Master used to do these things for Jintang when he was a child. Now that Jintang has come of age, he should help Master.”

His words were impeccable, and Yan Hanying couldn’t find the words to refuse, only saying, “Whatever you want.”

He lowered his eyes, seemingly hearing Jiang Jintang chuckle softly, but it was as if he had misheard, as if he were hallucinating.

Yan Hanying thought absentmindedly, perhaps he really had misheard. Who would be happy to tie someone else’s hair?

He couldn't help but recall things he hadn't understood before. He felt the system was inherently flawed; the unknown future and the known future made him incredibly anxious. Over this period, he slowly came to his senses. Some things he couldn't understand, while others he had grasped.

Actually, he wasn't afraid of death. It was more like he had some unfulfilled obsession; he didn't want to die easily before his ideals were realized.

Or perhaps it wasn't his obsession, but rather the obsession of the original owner of this body.

Yan Hanying rested his chin on his hand, staring blankly at his reflection in the mirror. He had seen this face enough over the past five years; he no longer felt the same disorientation he had when he first looked in the mirror.

This face was his own face. The original owner looked exactly like him, even the small mole on his temple was identical.

When the system arrived, it asked him why he adapted so well to the new era. Yan Hanying himself couldn't explain it; it was as if the body was tailor-made for him.

If he hadn't suddenly realized he'd chosen the wrong person, he might have continued living peacefully until his natural death, or perhaps died in a power struggle.

"Alright, Master," Jiang Jintang suddenly spoke, seeing him snap out of his reverie, "It's getting late. I'll accompany you out of the manor."

Yan Hanying instinctively wanted to tell him to stay and study, but the words caught in his throat as he recalled their conversation from yesterday, and he hesitated.

Perhaps Jiang Jintang really should rest for a few days; a balance of work and rest was necessary, and he couldn't be pushed too hard.

So Yan Hanying nodded and stood up.

Just as he turned around, Jiang Jintang suddenly leaned forward to meet him. Yan Hanying's eyes widened in surprise, feeling as if the young man's body temperature was being transferred to him, warm and comforting, carrying the cool fragrance of plum blossoms.

Yan Hanying subconsciously took a step back, but there was nowhere left to retreat, trapped between Jiang Jintang and the table and chairs.

Jiang Jintang seemed completely unaware, simply shaking off the cloak he was holding and gently draping it over Yan Hanying's shoulders, then bending slightly to tie the straps for him.

He saw Yan Hanying's fair and slender neck, the skin so thin, the veins so clearly visible, seemingly possessing a fatal attraction, tempting one to open their mouth and bite, drawing blood.

Jiang Jintang's heart skipped a beat, and he abruptly averted his gaze, suddenly noticing Yan Hanying's bright red earlobes.

One night, while Yan Hanying slept soundly due to incense, he had already shamelessly touched her earlobes. He couldn't forget the soft sensation, and he resented that he could only stealthily touch her at night, unable to openly express his love.

He feared seeing Yan Hanying's disgusted expression, but even more so, he worried about the world's condemnation of her because of it.

Even though he already had a bad reputation due to his many misdeeds.

Jiang Jintang quickly fastened the sash for him, then straightened up guiltily, not daring to look at Yan Hanying again, only saying, "Alright, Master, the hand warmer has been replaced with a new one, Master, don't forget to take it."

Yan Hanying also secretly breathed a sigh of relief, saying "Okay" somewhat awkwardly.

He was afraid that if Jiang Jintang got any closer, he would hear his heartbeat.

This child, how could he have suddenly grown so tall? He really looks like an adult now; he's still not quite used to it.

Yan Hanying hurriedly boarded the carriage, and Jiang Jintang called him again from outside, "Master."

Yan Hanying lifted the carriage curtain and looked at him.

It was still early, and the outside of the mansion was pitch black. Jiang Jintang held a lantern in his hand, the warm yellow light reflecting on his face, softening his features, and making his pale yellow robes appear even more gentle.

Yan Hanying had long known that Jiang Jintang was handsome, that he had always been so; otherwise, she wouldn't have raised him as the protagonist.

But as time passed, that thought faded, and she no longer paid much attention to his appearance.

But seeing him today, that long-forgotten thought resurfaced. She thought, Jiang Jintang seems to be growing more and more handsome.

In time, perhaps he'll find a girl he likes, get married, enter officialdom, and have his own residence.

Ultimately, they'll go their separate ways.

Yan Hanying felt a mix of emotions. She thought it wasn't so bad; at least they wouldn't have much contact in the future, and perhaps they wouldn't follow the same path as in the drama.

Yet, a lingering unease and displeasure remained, though she felt she was overthinking things.

Jiang Jintang should be focused on the imperial examinations at her age, not on early romance.

“Master,” Jiang Jintang called again, noticing his distracted state, “could you return earlier today?”

“We’ll see,” Yan Hanying replied, lowering the carriage curtain to conceal Jiang Jintang’s hesitant expression.

The bells on the carriage jingled softly. Jiang Jintang watched the carriage disappear into the distance, stood in the wind and snow for a while, and then murmured to herself, "New Year's Eve is approaching, but... I just wanted to spend a little longer with you."

But Yan Hanying was always busy. In court and in the harem, many things always fell on his shoulders. In previous years, Yan Hanying had been in the palace with the young emperor on New Year's Eve, leaving Jiang Jintang alone at home, watching the food on the table slowly grow cold.

Today, perhaps it would be the same as before.

Jiang Jintang lowered her eyes, about to return home, when she suddenly heard a very soft sound.
