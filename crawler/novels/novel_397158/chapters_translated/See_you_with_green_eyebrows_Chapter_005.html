Chapter 5 05 Like a Little Dog

Yue Jiao didn't quite understand what her master was saying for a moment. A hint of confusion appeared on her delicate face, and she hesitantly repeated, "My lord... what do you want to buy?"

"Buy a coffin," Yan Hanying coughed violently, but she already had her plan in mind. "Go now, buy the coffin, place it at Qu Qingliao's residence, and give it to Governor Qu Ning. If he asks, just say it was my idea. I'll explain it to him later. Besides, don't tell anyone else about this."

Yue Jiao, lost in thought, froze. After a long pause, she hesitated, then paused again before finally saying, "Then..."

"Jiang Jintang is forbidden too."

A look of conflict and sadness crossed Yue Jiao's face. She responded, but as if unable to contain herself, she leaned close to Yan Hanying's bedside and whispered, "My lord, did the doctor say you're dying?"

Yan Hanying: "..."

"It's alright, my lord," Yue Jiao sobbed softly, "I know everything, my lord. I will definitely arrange your funeral properly. May you rest in peace."

Before she finished speaking, Yan Hanying turned and punched her lightly, not too hard, just enough to leave her stunned.

Yue Jiao was stunned for a moment. Yan Hanying said angrily, "Whom do you wish to die? Don't think too much about it. Remember, don't tell Jiang Jintang."

Yan Hanying coughed twice, dismissed her, and lay down on the bed, lost in thought.

He had made up his mind. Staying in the manor and waiting to die was out of the question. He was never one to put his life in the hands of others; in this respect, he was almost identical to the original owner of this body. Therefore, although Yan Hanying was ignorant of court politics and had gradually risen to power over the past five years, it wasn't entirely due to the foundation laid by the original owner.

He couldn't just sit and wait to die. He wasn't originally from this world, nor was he some kind of powerful figure. He didn't feel much for the original owner's obsessions and greed. He didn't want imperial power, nor did he want influence.

From the beginning, he had come here with the idea of making the best of a situation, controlling the court according to the original owner's plans. He had met the young emperor, who, although young, genuinely liked Yan Hanying.

Yan Hanying retrieved the letters left by the original owner of the body. After reading the discussions and schemes, he understood that Yan Hanying didn't harbor much ill will towards the young emperor; he seemed to merely desire power and influence.

However, the Empress Dowager was pressing him hard. The two had once been allies in their power struggle, but now they were rivals, each hindering the other. Yan Hanying spent most of his time caring for the young emperor and dealing with the Empress Dowager's overt and covert maneuvers.

Besides this, Yan Hanying had nothing else he wanted to do.

Later, after raising Jiang Jintang, he thought it wouldn't be bad for Jiang Jintang to obtain an official position.

He had truly integrated himself completely into this world, hoping for stability and peace, but who could have foreseen this sudden turn of events?

Yan Hanying wasn't planning on dying early. He didn't know where he'd go after he died, and he felt the system was unreliable. He needed to find a way to survive.

If all else failed, he'd have to fake his death halfway through, escape the capital, and hide far away, never to be involved in the conflict between the protagonist and antagonist again.

Yan Hanying had his plans clear. A moment later, Jiang Jintang returned from outside the mansion, leading the dog into Yan Hanying's courtyard.

He handed the dog leash to the servant outside the gate, then took off his cloak and gave it to the maid Qingwu, casually asking, "Yuejiao rushed out of the mansion; what was she doing?"

His return made Yan Hanying inevitably tense again.

Having made his decision, he wasn't as panicked as before, but he was still somewhat worried about saying or doing something wrong that might provoke the villain's descent into darkness.

He found himself unable to look the child he had raised with his own hands in the eye, especially when the truth about their lukewarm relationship surfaced, making the thought even more terrifying.

Yan Hanying felt a chill run down her spine and remained silent for a long while. Jiang Jintang didn't think much of it, but leaned closer to the bed, bent down slightly, and carefully examined Yan Hanying. He said, "Your complexion is still so bad. Perhaps the medicine hasn't taken effect yet."

After a pause, he continued, "This morning, the Grand Secretary requested an audience. I stopped him outside the mansion and didn't let him in. After asking a few questions, the Grand Secretary was vague and refused to explain his purpose. I thought it might not be anything serious, so I sent him away."

Having finished speaking, Jiang Jintang carefully squatted down and looked at Yan Hanying, like a child who had made a mistake, pitifully asking, "Master, was what Jintang did wrong?"

Yan Hanying had no mind to deal with Xu Yingchun's matter anymore. Now, all she wanted was to secure her own future and avoid dying at Jiang Jintang's hands. Seeing Jiang Jintang's obsequious, pleading expression, Yan Hanying couldn't help but soften, instinctively wanting to pat his head as he used to.

But as soon as he raised his hand, fear forced him to stop.

Jiang Jintang, oblivious, only noticed Yan Hanying's hesitation, so he proactively leaned in and rubbed his head against Yan Hanying's palm.

Like a little puppy.

Yan Hanying was filled with mixed emotions. He closed his eyes, suppressing the urge to touch him again, and said calmly, "You did the right thing. Someone coming to my door for no reason can't be anything good. Have someone keep an eye on the Prime Minister's next move. Report any unusual activity to me first."

Jiang Jintang agreed, hesitated for a moment, and then said, "Autumn and winter are cold, and now it's snowing heavily. My master's health is already poor, and now he's bedridden. He shouldn't be too burdened with political affairs. If possible, I can share some of his burdens."

Yan Hanying subconsciously wanted to say that he wasn't studying properly and was thinking about working, but the words caught in his throat. His mind immediately cleared. He thought, "Is Jiang Jintang trying to undermine my power?"

Starting with small things, gradually seizing power—wasn't this the method Yan Hanying used to employ when dealing with the young emperor?

Yan Hanying swallowed her words, then thought it was for the best.

Political affairs were already busy enough; once Jiang Jintang was preoccupied, she could find an opportunity to escape.

So Yan Hanying said, "That's fine."

A pure and beautiful smile appeared on Jiang Jintang's face, her tone light and cheerful, "It's good that I can help my master."

Yan Hanying thought: You've got what you wanted; you must be overjoyed.

Throughout, not a single word of goodwill was reported.

“Then I won’t disturb Master’s rest any longer,” Jiang Jintang said respectfully, rising to his feet. “I’ll return for dinner to dine with Master.”

“If you have a classmate’s invitation, there’s no need to rush back.”

Jiang Jintang was unusually bewildered by his words.

Yan Hanying had always been very strict about his late returns.

He was ruthless in court, to a certain extent, making many enemies and offending many people.

Everyone knew he had a disciple he had raised for five years, clearly groomed as a confidant. Furthermore, Jiang Jintang had always been intelligent and astute in the academy, praised by the teachers on numerous occasions; he was destined for a career in the court.

Another new hidden danger.

Since Jiang Jintang entered the Yan family mansion, assassination attempts have been frequent. These included poisoning food delivered to the mansion and hiding darts on his way to school. Such incidents occurred often, and Jiang Jintang was not necessarily aware of them, but Yan Hanying dealt with them all cleanly with ruthless methods.

Yan Hanying was always worried that he would be harmed outside. Even though she knew that Jiang Jintang was now of age, had his own considerations and plans, and was no longer as defenseless as he was at twenty, she still required him to return to the mansion early at night and not to linger outside.

Therefore, Jiang Jintang almost never participated in any of his classmates' banquets. However, he was sensible from a young age and knew he was living under someone else's roof; he had never disobeyed Yan Hanying's instructions.

Now, Yan Hanying was actually asking him to accept a classmate's invitation, and he was unsure what Yan Hanying was thinking.

After a moment's thought, Jiang Jintang said vaguely, "Let's see, Master. They don't necessarily intend to invite me."

Yan Hanying began to ponder the meaning of Jiang Jintang's words.

Was he blaming him for being too strict in the past, resulting in Jiang Jintang having no friends?

Jiang Jintang had already gotten up and left.

As soon as he stepped out of the courtyard, the gentle expression on Jiang Jintang's face faded slightly, and his eyes turned somewhat cold. As he walked towards the gate, he said to the servant beside him, "Go and find out what Master has been planning lately."

Why had he suddenly become so cold towards him?
