Chapter 17 17 Could he really be gay...?

Jiang Jintang's fingertips, cool with the scent of well water, merely touched Yan Hanying's cheek. The chill spread with each touch, causing Yan Hanying to let out a soft groan, as if she were about to wake up.

Jiang Jintang, however, was unfazed. The spices he had given Yan Hanying contained a special hallucinogenic drug from the Western Regions. A small amount was intended to aid sleep, but a slightly larger dose would render someone into a deep, unconscious state.

He had strictly controlled the dosage, ensuring it wouldn't endanger her health, but he wouldn't let Yan Hanying wake up so easily.

Yan Hanying, usually so ruthless and decisive in court, was now powerless to resist, seemingly able to do whatever Jiang Jintang wanted.

Jiang Jintang, however, did not act impulsively. Suppressing her thoughts, she lifted Yan Hanying from between the tables and chairs and carried her to the bed.

Leaving the east wing, Jiang Jintang left the Yan residence and, under the cover of night, went to the pharmacy, saying she needed to get two doses of medicine for a cold.

The doctor, still awake late at night, welcomed Jiang Jintang into the room and closed the door.

The room was lit by candlelight; though not bright, it was enough for visibility.

Jiang Jintang saw one of the jailers on duty in the Red Gate Hall that day. The jailer nodded to her, exchanged greetings, and neither spoke much, both extremely cautious.

The doctor went to the front room to fetch medicine, and Jiang Jintang then asked, "Why did Master react so strongly today?"

"His figure was blocked, I didn't see clearly," the jailer said, "I vaguely saw that Mu Chen seemed to kiss Your Excellency's face?"

Jiang Jintang frowned. "You're not mistaken?"

"I shouldn't be mistaken," the jailer said, "Your Excellency dismissed us outside, and I didn't hear very clearly, but it seemed to be that Prince Shangjing seemed to have some improper thoughts about Your Excellency."

Jiang Jintang didn't say anything more, remaining silent.

He understood Prince Shangjing's feelings for his master all too well, but he hadn't expected Mu Chen to feel the same way.

He had known all along that Xiao Yan Hanying looked like this; so what if he had a venomous heart? Countless people would still flock to him, wanting both his body and his soul.

Prince Shangjing and Mu Chen wouldn't be the first, nor would they be the last.

He remained silent. The jailer beside him said many things, but he didn't fully hear them, finding them somewhat noisy.

Seeing his unpleasant expression, the jailer didn't continue.

After a while, Jiang Jintang asked again, "What was Master's purpose in going to the Red Gate Hall today?"

"Ah, I overheard a few words; it seems he was looking for Mu Chen's sister."

"Mu Chen has a sister?" Jiang Jintang's heart filled with suspicion. "What would Master want with Mu Chen's sister?"

Even Yan Hanying didn't know about this, let alone outsiders, so the jailer couldn't answer his question.

Wanting to stay out too long tonight might arouse suspicion, Jiang Jintang didn't want to linger. He took the medicine from the doctor and left, returning to the Yan residence through the snow. Before returning to his own courtyard, he went to check on Yan Hanying again. Yan Hanying was sleeping peacefully on the couch, soundly, though her curled-up posture seemed restless, a habit ingrained over many years.

Jiang Jintang knew little about Yan Hanying's past; it seemed even Yan Hanying herself knew very little, so he couldn't find anything amiss.

Jiang Jintang stood outside the window for a while. Night deepened, and the wind and snow intensified, making him feel cold.

Only then did Jiang Jintang leave the medicinal herbs in the small kitchen and return to his own courtyard to sleep.

Yan Hanying didn't sleep well that night. The kiss Mu Chen had given him during the day had truly startled him. In Da Ning, homosexuality was taboo; it was considered a defiled act. If discovered, the lightest consequence was dismissal from office, and the heaviest was death.

Besides that, there was the shame and gossip of the world, which no one could bear.

Therefore, in the five years he had lived in this world, Yan Hanying had never imagined that a gay man was beside him; he had assumed they were father and son. It was truly frightening.

He had a nightmare that night. In his dream, he was sitting in his mansion. It seemed to be a sunny day, with birds singing and flowers blooming outside the window. Someone from the palace summoned him, saying that His Majesty requested an audience.

Yan Hanying then got into a carriage and had someone take him to the palace.

Before the carriage even started moving, Jiang Jintang suddenly called out to him from outside, "Master."

Yan Hanying lifted the carriage curtain to look at Jiang Jintang, seemingly gesturing for him to speak.

Jiang Jintang's face held a strange resentment as he angrily said, "Between Mu Chen and me, you only care about Mu Chen, don't you?"

Yan Hanying wanted to say how could that be? He had raised Jiang Jintang for five years. Even knowing Jiang Jintang was a villain, he clearly distinguished between close and distant relationships. How could he care about an outsider?

But when he opened his mouth, he found himself unable to control his body, only hearing himself say, "Hmm."

Even Yan Hanying himself was taken aback by these words, as if they were unexpected.

Jiang Jintang, probably not expecting Yan Hanying to be so honest, was instantly filled with anger and gritted her teeth, asking, "Why?"

"No reason?" the Yan Hanying in the dream spoke calmly, "I will assist him in becoming the new emperor. What's yours will still be yours. I won't deprive you of anything, nor will I hinder your career. As for what I owe you, I will find a way to make it up to you after Mu Chen ascends the throne—"

Before she finished speaking, Jiang Jintang suddenly rushed onto the carriage, lifted the curtain, slipped inside, grabbed Yan Hanying's wrist, and kissed him heavily.

Yan Hanying gasped, jolting awake.

He stared blankly at the bed railing, his heart still pounding, as if he hadn't yet escaped the dream.

He was...dreaming about something...

Yan Hanying, somewhat irritated, pulled the covers up to hide his face, thinking that it must be because of what Mu Chen had done yesterday that he was having such a ridiculous dream.

No matter what, Jiang Jintang was a villain. According to the script, he should have wanted to kill him, so how could he...

kiss him?

Yan Hanying shook his head to clear his mind. As he stood up, a soreness rose in his back and shoulders. He rubbed his shoulders and called for Yue Jiao, asking someone to bring in some hot water for him to wash up.

Yue Jiao yawned and said, "My lord, you woke up very early today."

Yan Hanying was absent-minded and didn't speak.

He was still pondering why Jiang Jintang had killed him. He couldn't understand it. It was all over trivial matters. Although Jiang Jintang was two-faced, he didn't seem like someone prone to emotional outbursts or instability. How could he harbor thoughts of revenge against society over such small things?

Unless he had done something deeply hurtful to him later.

Yan Hanying was getting a headache from thinking about it. Then Yuejiao said, "Last night, the young master went to the pharmacy again and got two doses of medicine, which he put in the kitchen. Please take your medicine before going to court, sir."

See how considerate Jiang Jintang was? Perhaps he didn't harbor much hatred anymore.

Yan Hanying thought that if the murderous intent had arisen later, perhaps he could have avoided it.

He said Jiang Jintang was thoughtful. While putting on his outer robe, Jiang Jintang suddenly knocked on the door and said, "Master, may I come in?"

"Yes."

Jiang Jintang entered the room. The room was still warm and filled with the scent of incense. Yan Hanying sat in front of the dressing mirror, his hair not yet tied up, neatly and obediently draped behind him.

He had his back to Jiang Jintang, so she could only see half of his face in the mirror. His lips were red, his teeth white, and his complexion was very gentle, as if the person before her was not the usual demonic figure.

Jiang Jintang was lost in thought for a moment. Yan Hanying didn't hear him and, not knowing what mischief he was contemplating, turned around and asked, "Why have you been standing there?"

Ah. Yan Hanying's eyelashes trembled.

He's changed into new clothes.

The pale yellow robe didn't look feminine at all; instead, it exuded an air of nobility.

It seemed to be the fabric she'd brought back from Jiangnan. She'd ordered it thinking it might suit her; it turned out her taste wasn't bad after all.

Yan Hanying suddenly felt a burning sensation in her ears. Confused, she pinched them and turned her head back, only to hear her favorability rating increase by three points, returning to forty-one.

Yan Hanying stared blankly at herself in the mirror, wondering with some doubt, "Could it be that Jiang Jintang likes me like this?"

Favorability rating… what kind of favorability rating was that…?

Could he really be gay…?

[Author's Note]

Yingzi is only now starting to think about what kind of favorability rating was being added (laughs)
