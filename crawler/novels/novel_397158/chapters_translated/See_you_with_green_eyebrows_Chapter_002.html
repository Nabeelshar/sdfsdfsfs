Chapter 2 02 The Eunuch Party in Power

Jiang Jintang squatted in front of Yan Hanying, her face upturned, smiling innocently, yet Yan Hanying felt a chill run down his spine, a sense of foreboding creeping over him.

“Who did Master kill this time?”

Yan Hanying's lips parted, and he heard a system notification.

Oh no! Yan Hanying's spine tightened; he thought, “I'm doomed.”

He knew the protagonist abhorred killing, and his reputation in court was poor. For years, he had avoided Jiang Jintang when executing those who stood in his way, rarely lifting a finger himself, fearing Jiang Jintang would find out he had done it personally and lose favor.

Yang Jintang had still noticed his actions.

The system finally issued its ultimatum.

Yan Hanying's wildly beating heart calmed for a moment.

Three values added?

What does this mean?

Yan Hanying was a little confused. She had thought Jiang Jintang would dislike this kind of thing, but now it seemed that wasn't entirely true.

Lost in thought, Jiang Jintang added, "Master, in your days navigating the court, you had to conceal some of your brilliance, lest you attract suspicion and become a target of gossip."

"He's just a guard who made a mistake," Yan Hanying said vaguely. "He's not one of my men. Someone will punish him for his mistakes. I only glanced at the prison and inadvertently got a bit of blood on me."

Jiang Jintang seemed to believe him. He stood up; his youthful figure had grown tall and imposing without Yan Hanying noticing, casting a shadow that completely enveloped Yan Hanying.

The current emperor was still young, his father deceased, and only Yan Hanying and his grandmother took turns raising him.

While ostensibly assisting the emperor, the court was in reality a system of dual control and checks and balances. Yan Hanying controlled all political affairs, while the Empress Dowager and her relatives held military power, and the entire court was already in disarray.

The Empress Dowager was a devout Buddhist, and suddenly, a Buddhist cult flourished throughout Da Ning.

Jiang Jintang had been at the temple with his classmates for almost seven days. After not seeing him for seven days, Yan Hanying felt he was still the same, yet he also felt he had changed somewhat.

Especially when he stood before him, he felt a sense of oppression and unease.

Yan Hanying felt a vague discomfort. He looked up and met Jiang Jintang's gaze for a moment. This posture suddenly made him uneasy, making Jiang Jintang seem superior, his imposing presence making Yan Hanying feel somewhat flustered.

Jiang Jintang quickly averted her gaze, lowered her head slightly, and looked extremely respectful, saying, "I'll go back to my room to wash up first. What would you like to eat for dinner, Master? I'll have the kitchen prepare it."

Yan Hanying then thought she was overthinking things; perhaps the temple food was bland, and she was too tired from the journey, which made her look a little thinner.

He waved his hand and said, "No need to prepare dinner for me. I have matters to discuss with the Grand Secretary, and I don't know when I'll be back."

Jiang Jintang responded, and seeing Yan Hanying get up to call a maid, she suddenly grabbed his wrist. "Master's hair isn't styled yet; let Jintang comb it for you."

Yan Hanying didn't refuse. He sat in his chair, the young man standing behind him, holding his hair. Yan Hanying thought to himself that raising a child wasn't bad, especially one like Jiang Jintang—obedient and sensible. He wasn't yet of retirement age, and he could rely on the young man's care.

If Jiang Jintang passed the imperial examinations in the future and obtained an official position, he could confidently relinquish his power and enjoy a life of leisure.

He was lost in his daydreams when he suddenly felt a tingling sensation on the back of his neck and couldn't help but turn his head slightly.

The next instant, Jiang Jintang raised her hand and cupped his head.

Her breath fell on Yan Hanying's head, bringing a ticklish sensation. Jiang Jintang once again lightly brushed her fingertips across the back of his neck, brushing away the stray hairs, and said seemingly casually, "Master, don't move around, or your hair will get messed up."

Yan Hanying's ears suddenly felt a little hot, and he touched his earlobe uncomfortably, without saying anything more.

The snow continued to fall all day.

Yan Hanying's relationship with this Assistant Minister was merely ordinary. Currently, most of the officials in the court were personally promoted by Yan Hanying. Those officials who had been selected through the imperial examinations looked down on Yan Hanying and disliked his control of the government, yet they were forced into a position of power by his authority and had no way to express their grievances.

This Assistant Minister, Ying Chun, was one of them. He was indeed a loyal and capable minister who couldn't tolerate any dissent. When he first entered officialdom, he even verbally abused Yan Hanying in front of her. Yan Hanying didn't get angry with him, nor did she punish him. She merely used a pretext to kill a few of his attendants or minor officials. After killing one or two, Xu Yingchun even boasted that Yan Hanying would surely suffer a terrible death.

After killing the fifth, Xu Yingchun compromised, knowing that Yan Hanying wielded considerable power and had no choice but to restrain himself.

Today's banquet was also to apologize, express his loyalty, and earnestly request Yan Hanying not to harm those around him again.

Xu Yingchun was the host, and Yan Hanying was the guest, yet in the banquet hall, Yan Hanying sat high in the main seat, listening to Xu Yingchun's apology with a smile.

Yan Hanying's slender fingers rested on the rim of the wine cup, her chin resting on her hand as she lightly traced the edge.

Xu Yingchun's tone was somewhat stiff. "Your Excellency, the Grand Secretary, is magnanimous. It was I who was impolite. In my half-year service, I have often offended you. I beg Your Excellency to show mercy and punish me, sparing the innocent people around me."

"Oh," Yan Hanying retorted, "Of those who died, which one was innocent?"

Xu Yingchun's words caught in his throat, unsure how to speak. His back stiffened, knowing that Yan Hanying was putting him in a difficult position.

After a long pause, he cautiously said, "I heard that the Grand Secretary released my bodyguard and imprisoned him. He's just a bodyguard, and he only acts according to his master's orders—"

"Does the Grand Secretary mean that the man's attempt to poison me was all at the Grand Secretary's behest?"

The room fell silent for a moment. Xu Yingchun, covered in cold sweat, knelt down before Yan Hanying with a thud. "Grand Secretary, you jest! I wouldn't dare have such a treasonous thought."

"Hmm," Yan Hanying said, resting her chin on her hand, showing little interest and no desire to continue the conversation. "Since that's the case, that man's insubordination was his own idea, and he's hardly an innocent person. Your Excellency, next time you choose a servant, it would be best to pick someone who won't cause you any trouble, lest they implicate you and cost you your life."

The table was laden with food and wine, but Yan Hanying hadn't touched a drop. He rose and said, "My lord, please rise. I'm merely a castrated eunuch; how can I bear such a kneeling from you? It's too much of an honor."

He casually rolled up his sleeve, bent down, and with his slender white fingers grasped Xu Yingchun's arm, forcefully pulling him up.

Xu Yingchun dared not meet his gaze, his body stiff as a board, wondering how Yan Hanying intended to torment him next.

But Yan Hanying had no interest in humiliating him further. He simply said the meal was meaningless, turned, and left.

Xu Yingchun stood there for a moment, a chill still running down his spine, until a maidservant hurried in from outside and helped him sit down.

Xu Yingchun then seemed to come back to his senses, letting out a long sigh and muttering, "The eunuchs in power, wielding their tyranny, are truly a misfortune for Da Ning..."

"Alas—"

Outside the window, snow continued to fall, and birds flew into the depths of the night, seemingly disturbing the candlelight on the table. The candlelight flickered, and someone gently covered it with a hand.

A jade ring adorned a slender finger, and the cuffs of his blue robe were embroidered with intricate, dark patterns. In the candlelight, a hint of cold melancholy crept onto his young and gentle face.

Jiang Jintang straightened up, closed the window behind him, and asked, "Did Master really say that?"

"Yes, he said the guard poisoned him, which is why he's being interrogated in the dungeon."

Jiang Jintang picked up a pen and wrote on the paper, "Just for his own selfish desires."

Before he finished speaking, the person who had answered earlier said again, "The messenger pigeon has sent another letter to the young master, saying that the person put arsenic in the Grand Master's food box, but it was intercepted halfway."

"Food box?" Jiang Jintang asked疑惑地, "What food box?"

"It's the food box that was supposed to be sent to the temple for the young master in the letter the other day, but it was poisoned halfway there, so it had to be postponed."

Jiang Jintang seemed stunned for a moment, then the coldness on his face softened, and he regained his usual gentle demeanor.

"If that's the case, then Master's intentions are truly kind."
