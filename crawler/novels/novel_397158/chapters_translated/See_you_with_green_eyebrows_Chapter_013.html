Chapter 13 13 If One Could Be a Good Person

The Emperor had already spoken, and no matter how much the ministers insisted, they couldn't convict Yan Hanying without cause.

They could only watch as Yan Hanying ran rampant in the court.

Yan Hanying now controlled the young Emperor, who was merely a puppet. The Empress Dowager was old, but still held military power. The presence of the maternal relatives was a rare way to restrain Yan Hanying; otherwise, the entire Da Ning would probably have already changed hands to the Yan family.

When Yan Hanying arrived, the original owner had already done many evil deeds to seize power. He knew the original owner was a clever man, aware that shared glory and shared loss. If he had truly become Emperor, he wouldn't have actually burned the country to the ground; these tyrannical actions seemed more like a deliberate act of revenge.

However, the original owner's memories were incomplete. Yan Hanying didn't know why he entered the palace, or how he managed to remain unharmed—he was just a fake eunuch.

She also didn't understand why the original owner had committed such evil deeds.

Yan Hanying was lost in thought for a moment when the officials below began to discuss other matters, mentioning that the Empress Dowager had been bedridden recently.

Yan Hanying said, "The inner palace has its own imperial physicians; let's discuss official business in the court."

"The Empress Dowager fell ill because of the actions of the Grand Secretary. She was originally worried about her nephew. If the Grand Secretary hadn't detained people without cause, this wouldn't have happened."

"That's what you mean," Yan Hanying couldn't help but laugh, "If that thief hadn't poisoned the filling first, why would I have made things difficult for him? All these things, each and every one of them..." "Didn't he orchestrate this himself?"

"Alright," King Shangjing whispered to his minister, "Yan Hanying is now insisting my adopted son is guilty. If all else fails, we'll have to pressure him from other angles."

"It was Yan Hanying who started this by settling a personal score. The young marquis is young and ignorant; his mistake doesn't warrant this."

King Shangjing knew in his heart that Mu Chen was at fault, and it wasn't as simple as his colleagues made it out to be.

Poisoning and murder are serious offenses, capable of taking a life. Anyone would be furious, let alone someone as vengeful as Yan Hanying.

But then King Shangjing remembered his disciple beside him.

He had investigated Jiang Jintang's background; he was an orphan, raised by Feng Liang at the academy, and had consistently achieved high scores in the imperial examinations, always ranking among the successful candidates. It was indeed a remarkably intelligent child, no wonder Yan Hanying valued him so highly.

However, he couldn't forget the look in Jiang Jintang's eyes when they met that day, blocking his way. He always felt that Jiang Jintang's feelings for Yan Hanying had gone beyond the bond between teacher and student; every action seemed to cross the line.

Prince Shangjing harbored suspicions but dared not mention them to outsiders, fearing that speaking too much would reveal his own thoughts.

Mu Chen wasn't that important to him either; it was only because he saw Mu Chen's intelligence and that Mu Chen had personally come to him wanting to become his adopted son that Prince Shangjing, seeing his sincerity, had taken him into his household.

He had orchestrated the poisoning, and now that it had been exposed, all he needed to do was clear himself of blame and abandon the perpetrator.

His recent urging of other officials to join him in attacking Yan Hanying was merely a ploy to cause him trouble.

Since Yan Hanying wasn't so easy to deal with, he would find another opportunity.

With Prince Shangjing taking the lead, the others fell silent.

At Chenshi (7-9 AM), with no major events in court, Yan Hanying reminded the young emperor to adjourn the court and then accompanied him to his bedchamber.

Palace maids sweeping the streets encountered them on the way and bowed. Yan Hanying merely nodded, quickly leaving them behind, and said only to the young emperor, "His Majesty lied this morning."

The young emperor tensed up again. "I..."

"Who entered the palace last night and chatted so pleasantly with His Majesty that he slept late and woke up late this morning?" Yan Hanying seemed to know everything. He didn't look at the young emperor, and his tone wasn't stern, but the young emperor... The Emperor remained stiff, saying, "No, it's really just that I didn't sleep well last night."

Yan Hanying remained silent for a long while. The young Emperor swallowed hard, walked cautiously for a while longer, and finally heard Yan Hanying say, "In that case, I'll have someone bring some calming incense so Your Majesty can sleep better tonight."

"Thank you...thank you, Grand Secretary."

Yan Hanying wasn't usually idle in the palace; she would occasionally supervise the young Emperor's studies, watching him read.

Although the harem was under the control of the Empress Dowager, the young Emperor wasn't lacking in food or clothing. His bedchamber was fully equipped, and a charcoal brazier provided warmth.

Yan Hanying then took off her cloak, sat in a chair with a hand warmer in hand, and rested her chin on her hand, watching the young Emperor read.

He thought absentmindedly, the young emperor was only ten years old. To say he was sensible was an understatement; to say he was completely ignorant was also inaccurate. It would take at least five or six more years for him to grow up and be able to stand on his own.

The original owner of this body had gone to such lengths to raise a young emperor—did he really intend to seize the throne himself?

“My lord,” Qingmeng, the young emperor’s personal maid, served him tea, speaking softly, “Please have some tea.”

Yan Hanying snapped out of his reverie. “Thank you.”

“No need for thanks, my lord,” Qingmeng smiled shyly. “You haven’t been to the palace much lately. I thought you liked tea, so I always kept some on hand for you, but I didn’t expect you to not come for so many days.”

Yan Hanying didn’t detect the girl’s thoughts and simply replied casually, “I have matters to attend to outside the palace. His Majesty is getting on in years; it’s best if I don’t bother you.” "Alright, so you won't blame me for meddling later."

As soon as she finished speaking, Qingmeng suddenly sobbed softly, saying, "We understand your difficulties, sir, and we know you're doing this for His Majesty's good. It's the injustice of the world; if people could be good, who would choose to do evil?"

After speaking, the girl sighed softly again, took out a handkerchief to wipe her eyes, and said softly, "Qingmeng lost her composure."

"It's alright." Yan Hanying sometimes marveled at the deep bonds of friendship among the palace maids around the young emperor, which was why she had never mistreated them.

The young emperor was still studying nearby, and Qingmeng said it was inconvenient to disturb him, so she left after serving the tea.

Yan Hanying sat in the hall for a while longer, checking the young emperor's recitation and studies. Seeing that the emperor was a bit slow-witted but still obedient, he rose to say he had to leave.

The young emperor hurriedly ordered someone to escort him out of the palace.

Yan Hanying said, "No need. It's cold outside; Your Majesty should be careful not to catch a cold."

The eunuch closed the palace gates and followed Yan Hanying for a while. Suddenly, Yan Hanying asked, "Was no one really here last night?"

"No, sir."

Yan Hanying had some doubts, but the eunuchs and maids were his informants; if they all said this, the young emperor probably wasn't lying.

Yet, he still felt he had overlooked something.

Once in the carriage, he remembered what Qingmeng had said earlier.

"If one could be a good person, who would choose to do evil?"

Yan Hanying leaned against the window, lost in thought, wondering if the original owner of this body truly had some hidden secret.

The carriage continued forward when Yan Hanying suddenly heard the driver say, "Sir, the young master is ahead."

"Hmm?"

Yan Hanying subconsciously lifted the curtain and saw Jiang Jintang standing ahead. The wind and snow were so heavy; he was probably buying something at a shop, his hands already red from the cold.

The system was following beside him, looking rather pathetic, wagging its tail and drooling.

Yan Hanying, hurriedly wondering why Jiang Jintang had taken the system with him, quickly sent someone to fetch Jiang Jintang. The servant responded and was about to leave when Yan Hanying suddenly remembered the matter of favorability. She handed him the hand warmer, saying, "Warm his hands, lest they get frostbite."

The servant then took his hand warmer to find Jiang Jintang. At that moment, Jiang Jintang had just received the pastry, casually breaking off a piece to feed the dog. He still possessed the upright and elegant demeanor of bamboo, yet remained exceptionally refined. As he straightened up, it seemed he had just noticed Yan Hanying's carriage, and a flicker of emotion appeared in his expression.

The servant handed him a hand warmer, saying, "The master saw you on the road, young master, and was worried your hands were frostbitten. He sent me to bring you this hand warmer so you can ride back to the manor in the carriage."

Jiang Jintang looked up at the carriage window, meeting Yan Hanying's gaze directly.

Yan Hanying noticed his eyes narrow slightly when he smiled; his smile was truly beautiful, like a pretty little bird.

His heart skipped a beat. Just as he looked away, he heard a "ding."
