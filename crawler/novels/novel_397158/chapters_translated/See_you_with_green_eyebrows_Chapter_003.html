Chapter 3 03 Wasn't he number one?

Yan Hanying suddenly opened his eyes.

The candles in the room were already out; he had long since gone to bed. He had only thought about Jiang Jintang before falling asleep, but he hadn't seen her. How could his favorability rating have increased?

Yan Hanying was bewildered. He lay there with his eyes open for a while, then drowsiness overwhelmed him, so he closed his eyes and fell asleep again.

As he drifted off to sleep, someone in his mind suddenly spoke excitedly: "In your past life, you fell in love with him, but couldn't have him, and dared not express your feelings! Later, you forced yourself on him, and finally! Holy crap!"

After that, a flood of unfamiliar memories suddenly rushed into Yan Hanying's mind.

In his memory, he saw a tall, slender young man, wrapped in a fox fur cloak and carrying a hand warmer, standing before the academy. Before him stood a boy of about fifteen, looking up timidly at the man.

That was himself at twenty. Yan Hanying recognized him; he remembered the scene of his first encounter with Jiang Jintang.

But the memories that followed were all jumbled up. The boy's angry eyes, the incoherent, unintelligible arguments, and the smoke and fire of battle—all rushed back to him in a chaotic rush.

Until Jiang Jintang drew his longsword and pierced his heart.

At that moment, the pain seemed to pierce through the dream. Yan Hanying felt a real ache coursing through his body. He abruptly opened his eyes, staring blankly at the bed curtains, unable to recover for a long time.

The system in his mind was still frantically shouting. Yan Hanying murmured, "You..."

"Holy crap!" the system exclaimed again, "You...you...how come you're adapting so well to ancient times?"

"I..." Yan Hanying hadn't come to his senses yet, "I was killed by Jiang Jintang? Isn't he the protagonist? How could he be...the villain?"

"What villain..." The system flipped through the script in Yan Hanying's hands, then fell silent for a long time.

Yan Hanying was still muttering to himself, "How could he be the villain? Isn't he the protagonist?"

"This..."

The room fell silent for a moment.

Yan Hanying's mind felt like it was about to explode. The memories were incomplete, but even so, they felt like he had personally experienced them. A chill ran down his spine, completely blending into the winter chill.

He sat up abruptly, his face ashen, as if he had just died.

"Su..."

Before the system could finish speaking, Yan Hanying hurriedly got out of bed, not even bothering to find his shoes and socks, and ran barefoot towards the door.

Just as he opened the door, a tall figure stood outside, holding a lantern and blocking his path.

Yan Hanying gasped in shock, his hand gripping the door trembling uncontrollably. Before the other person could move, he forcefully slammed the door shut.

Jiang Jintang, somewhat bewildered, grabbed the doorframe, stopping his movement. "Master?"

Master…
Upon hearing this, Yan Hanying gasped sharply. His jumbled thoughts suddenly cleared, but he became increasingly terrified. Ignoring Jiang Jintang's hand still gripping the doorframe, he slammed it shut.

Jiang Jintang quickly withdrew her hand, managing not to be crippled.

"Bang!"

The door slammed shut.

Yan Hanying leaned against the door, his mind racing with countless flashbacks, each one reminding him—"You raised the wrong person."

He raised the wrong person.

Jiang Jintang was the villain, not the protagonist.

The person who killed him was Jiang Jintang.

"How could this be? Isn't Jiang Jintang very obedient and smart?

Didn't he always get first place?"

Yan Hanying blurted out, "Isn't he number one? How can he be a villain?"

"Ah... Host..." the system said cautiously, "Didn't you tutor him to get first place?"

Yan Hanying: "..."

The young man outside the door hadn't left yet, probably unaware of what had happened. He stood outside the door, holding a lantern, somewhat bewildered, and gently knocked, asking, "Master, what happened?"

As he spoke, Yan Hanying heard the favorability rating announcement sound.

[Affection -1, Current Affection 52]

[Affection -1, Current Affection 51]

[Affection -2, Current Affection 49]

The broadcast continued, the system crashing and yelling: "Aaaaaah, Host! If the affection drops any further, you'll turn evil! Forty-seven! Forty-five! Aaaaaah! Wake up! If it drops below twenty, he'll stab you to death!"

Yan Hanying snapped out of his daze. He opened the door again, and Jiang Jintang tilted her head, looking at him with a puzzled expression.

He saw that Yan Hanying's pale, bloodless face was covered in cold sweat, as if he had just woken from a nightmare.

"Master? Why is your face so pale? Did you have a nightmare last night?" Jiang Jintang clutched her sleeve and reached out to wipe the sweat from Yan Hanying's face.

Yan Hanying found this man utterly terrifying. This heinous villain could feign such innocence, his favorability rating plummeting, yet he could still stand before him, acting as if nothing was amiss, ingratiating himself.

A chill ran down Yan Hanying's spine. The fear and pain of being pierced through the heart by a sword seemed to linger. His body stiffened, and he suddenly understood how other officials usually acted in his presence.

So, the moment Jiang Jintang touched his forehead, Yan Hanying shuddered, taking two steps back in panic. His lower back slammed against the table, causing it to tilt, the candlelight to wobble, and then toppling over.

Jiang Jintang quickly bent down to catch him, but Yan Hanying, as if startled, took a step back, knocking the table slightly off course.

Jiang Jintang missed his target, losing his balance. Meeting Yan Hanying's startled gaze, he saw his own face. Then, he tackled Yan Hanying to the ground.

His master's body was somewhat stiff. Jiang Jintang thought, he seemed afraid of something.

Jiang Jintang was lost in thought for a moment, until Yan Hanying struggled to get up, before he realized he was pinning him down.

In a very intimate position.

He hurriedly got up, and seeing Yan Hanying trying to get up, he reached out and grabbed his arm.

Yan Hanying instinctively tried to break free, but the system suddenly said, "Host! Favorability!"

More than being touched, he feared Jiang Jintang turning evil, so he could only endure the discomfort and let Jiang Jintang help him up.

Yan Hanying's scalp tingled, and he stood up rather awkwardly, facing Jiang Jintang, but didn't look up at him.

Jiang Jintang thought to himself that they hadn't seemed like this during the day, but why were they so distant at night? A slight displeasure welled up inside him, but he didn't show it on his face, only saying, "My fault for being clumsy. Did Master hurt himself?"

He seemed concerned, and leaned closer again, seemingly wanting to check Yan Hanying's body.

Although Yan Hanying was a transmigrator, he had spent five years navigating the imperial court, serving as its chief secretary for just as long. He was exactly like the original owner of this body—cunning, ruthless, and treacherous, having witnessed countless hypocritical and deceitful people.

Jiang Jintang's demeanor was something he had often seen. Initially, he had only thought Jiang Jintang was a decent person, but now, he seemed even more cunning and terrifying.

Yan Hanying had been too confident in his judgment, truly regarding Jiang Jintang as the protagonist, and had thus been deceived.

Yan Hanying's nervousness intensified. For a moment, he remained silent, instinctively trying to avoid Jiang Jintang's touch.

But the system whispered reassurance, "Host, please bear with it! You must maintain your favorability rating!"

Yan Hanying closed her eyes, struggling to suppress the jumbled memories and emotions, constantly reassuring herself that the young man before her hadn't yet turned evil and wouldn't kill her. She spoke haltingly, "I...I'm fine. I just had a nightmare last night and haven't recovered yet."

The favorability rating display had paused, currently stuck at forty-two, showing no sign of changing.

He took a deep breath and asked, "Why are you looking for me so late at night? Is something the matter?"

Yan Hanying didn't dare meet the villain's gaze. He turned his face away; outside the open door, the wind and snow were howling. He then looked away again, noticing that Jiang Jintang was covered in snow. A charcoal brazier was burning inside, and the snow had melted, leaving a damp patch on his shoulders and hair.

After all, he had raised this child for five years. Although Yan Hanying had been strict in his upbringing, he had always been quite caring towards Jiang Jintang.

When Jiang Jintang returned to the manor at fifteen, he had fallen seriously ill. His recovery was slow and painful; he had been bedridden for a whole month, and Yan Hanying had been diligently caring for him ever since.

Seeing him soaked in snow, Yan Hanying instinctively reached out to wipe the moisture from his clothes, but quickly withdrew her hand, unable to overcome the urge in her heart.

If it were merely knowing the other was a villain, it wouldn't be so bad, but the fact that he had witnessed those memories of his past life—the sense of death and despair—was simply too intense; he couldn't forget them.

So the two remained silent for a moment until Jiang Jintang said, "The snow is heavy tonight. Jintang was worried that Master might be cold at night, so I came to ask if he still needed charcoal."

These past few days, there had been many affairs at court, and the Empress Dowager was intentionally suppressing Yan Hanying. He was overwhelmed with work at court and had no energy to manage affairs at home, so he had now entrusted everything to Jiang Jintang.

Inquiring about winter supplies in each courtyard was not inherently wrong, but Jiang Jintang had already moved out of Yan Hanying's courtyard and was living in his own room, so there was really no need for him to come over in person at night.

Yan Hanying wasn't sure what Jiang Jintang meant. He was now paranoid, feeling that Jiang Jintang had ill intentions, but aside from his villainous identity, he couldn't think of any reason why Jiang Jintang would resent him, let alone harbor murderous intent.

He couldn't understand, and Jiang Jintang, unaware of his thoughts, simply turned and went behind the screen to retrieve Yan Hanying's shoes and socks, then knelt down to put them on for him.

He grabbed Yan Hanying's ankle, and the oppressive feeling of being caught in a hunter's net struck her again. Yan Hanying was stiff and unable to move, almost suffocating.
