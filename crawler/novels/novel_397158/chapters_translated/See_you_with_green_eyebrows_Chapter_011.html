Chapter 11 11 Night Visit

Yan Hanying was also somewhat depressed. Before he knew Jiang Jintang was the villain, he had imagined his future life more than once.

He knew he was a treacherous villain hated to the core by the entire Da Ning, and he would always have to find a way to distance himself from the court and even the capital.

Back then, he was thinking about where he could easily associate with Jiang Jintang. In just a few days, he had changed his mind and was now thinking about how to avoid her.

Yan Hanying simply felt uncomfortable.

Jiang Jintang had no idea what Yan Hanying was thinking. He noticed that Yan Hanying had been absent-minded lately. Although the matter of Mu Chen's poisoning had been complicated, he could clearly sense that Yan Hanying no longer seemed to be paying attention to him.

This made Jiang Jintang somewhat uneasy. He didn't understand why Yan Hanying had suddenly changed like this, and wondered if the other party had discovered his feelings.

Each lost in their own thoughts, but fortunately the journey back to the manor wasn't short. Jiang Jintang couldn't help but ask, "Did Master and Prince Shangjing have a conflict before?"

Yan Hanying blinked, snapping out of her reverie, then closed her eyes again, leaning back on the soft cushions. She replied, "More than a conflict. Before, we were close friends."

The original owner of this body and Prince Shangjing were friends—this was something Yan Hanying knew from her memories when she transmigrated. Yan Hanying was very young when she entered the palace, and her childhood memories were fragmented; she only remembered that life in the palace wasn't very good.

She had truly suffered a lot, growing up as a eunuch.

Prince Shangjing, a kind and righteous man, saw that Yan Hanying was having a hard time and intentionally helped her, giving her the opportunity to go to the Eastern Palace to accompany the Crown Prince as a playmate. As the prince grew older, the late emperor grew suspicious of him. Later, the prince was framed and died, leaving behind his unborn child in the Eastern Palace, who was personally cared for by Yan Hanying.

At that time, the palace was in turmoil, and everyone was in danger. Yan Hanying wanted to take the eldest grandson away from the capital for a while and asked Prince Shangjing for help.

He was cautious and careful, but also intended to use this opportunity to control the eldest grandson. However, he underestimated the Empress Dowager's power and forgot that Prince Shangjing was related to the Empress Dowager.

He lied, disguising the eldest grandson as his distant nephew, saying he was taking him back to his hometown. However, the deception was exposed, and the prince was arrested by the emperor before even leaving the capital.

The crime wasn't particularly serious, but it wasn't insignificant either. While fleeing with the prince to escape disaster was supposedly for the prince's good, it could also be interpreted as an intentional kidnapping of the eldest grandson. Yan Hanying couldn't explain himself clearly and asked Prince Shangjing to testify, but Prince Shangjing refused to vouch for him.

Only then did Yan Hanying realize that he was ultimately just a lowly eunuch. He had been deceived by the prince into believing they were friends when nothing was wrong, but when trouble struck, the prince was willing to stand up for a servant.

When the truth was revealed—the crown prince had no intention of plotting a rebellion, yet innocent people had died—the emperor, wanting to vent his anger, conveniently took it out on Yan Hanying.

He suffered greatly in prison, but ultimately, it was only because the Crown Prince kept crying and making a scene, and no one else could manage, that Yan Hanying was released to care for the Crown Prince.

His past with Prince Shangjing was never mentioned again. Yan Hanying had gotten to where he was today through his own intellect, and he knew that Prince Shangjing had looked down on him before, and that there had been many political disputes after he came to power. It was unknown whether Prince Shangjing had ever regretted his actions.

Yan Hanying offered a casual explanation, which Jiang Jintang took to heart. Though her emotions remained hidden, she simply said, "Treat your master this way; parting ways is the right thing to do. It's just a pity for your master's sincere heart."

Yan Hanying wasn't the original owner of this body, and she had been particularly angry when she remembered such things. Now, however, she didn't dwell on it much, only coldly scoffing, "They say I'm heartless and ungrateful? Which of these royal relatives isn't more heartless than me?"

The rest were merely pawns in the power struggle within the imperial court.

The carriage had stopped at the mansion's main gate. Yan Hanying alighted, coughed twice, and as soon as she entered the hall, Jiang Jintang called to a servant, "Prepare medicine for Master first, and fetch a new hand warmer."

After giving these instructions, he seemed to remember something and added, "That hand warmer was a gift I gave to Master."

There was a hint of resentment in his voice, which Yan Hanying clearly sensed. She paused, hesitantly wondering if Jiang Jintang might easily turn hostile over such a trivial matter.

Perhaps he didn't care about the damage to her favorability rating and was just saying it casually.

Yan Hanying said, "It's just a hand warmer."

He passed through the hanging flower gate. The young man behind him still seemed somewhat downcast. After taking a few more steps, seeing that Jiang Jintang hadn't returned to his room, Yan Hanying finally couldn't help but stop and ask, "What are you unhappy about?"

"Nothing," Jiang Jintang bit his lower lip and said softly, "Nothing's bothering me."

"If there's nothing, then go back and rest," Yan Hanying felt that he was putting too much pressure on him and was always overthinking things. "I want to take a bath and rest."

After entering the room, he asked Yuejiao to prepare hot water. When he turned around, Jiang Jintang was still with him, slightly bent over in front of the dressing table, carefully lighting the incense on the table.

Yan Hanying smelled the fragrance. "Changed it?"

"Yes," Jiang Jintang smiled at him, "It's calming incense. Master has been having trouble sleeping lately due to a cold. Yuejiao told me, so I had someone make this calming incense to keep on hand. Perhaps it will make Master feel a little more comfortable."

Yan Hanying's expression softened slightly, but he still scolded her, saying, "I told you to focus on the imperial examinations, but instead, you're thinking about these things all day."

[Favorability +1, current favorability 47]

Yan Hanying paused, stunned.

He always found it strange where Jiang Jintang's favorability had increased so much. Having spent so many years in the court, Yan Hanying was adept at manipulating people, but he couldn't understand where Jiang Jintang's favorability came from.

He was lost in thought for a moment, and Jiang Jintang chuckled and apologized, saying he would definitely study diligently when he got back and wouldn't worry his master.

Yan Hanying wasn't worried to begin with. Even if Jiang Jintang only got first place after extra lessons, it was enough for him. All he could do was pave a smooth path for Jiang Jintang's official career, so he wouldn't take any wrong turns.

Jiang Jintang lit incense and left. After bathing, Yan Hanying went to bed, flipped through the book beside him, and fell into a deep sleep after reading only a few words.

The night always felt stuffy.

Yan Hanying dreamt he was sweating profusely from the heat, his mouth slightly open as he tried to breathe, but it felt like something was blocking his lips and teeth, making it equally difficult to breathe.

He couldn't wake up, struggling in his dream, as if imprisoned, unable to move.

After a long while, consciousness finally returned to his body. He coughed lightly and opened his eyes groggily.

Outside the window, snow weighed down bamboo stalks, which fell to the ground with a soft thud.

The slight, fragmented sounds only made the night seem more tranquil.

Yan Hanying felt thirsty and got up to drink some water. His lips touched the rim of the cup, but he suddenly felt a swelling.

Yan Hanying touched his lips in confusion, finding nothing unusual, but inexplicably remembered what Jiang Jintang had said to Prince Shangjing outside the Red Gate Hall during the day.

He knew absolutely nothing about homosexuality. At the time, he only thought Jiang Jintang had spoken carelessly in anger, but now, thinking back, something seemed amiss.

But he couldn't quite put his finger on it. He only asked himself why he was thinking about these things for no reason. He put down his cup and returned to the bed.

Not long after, the breathing in the room gradually calmed down; Yan Hanying had fallen asleep.

The figure that had stood motionless outside the door for an unknown amount of time suddenly swayed slightly, the hem of its robe fluttering gently with the movement, and in the blink of an eye, it was gone, its footprints disappearing into the snow.

In a few moments, the falling snow covered the trail of footprints, as if no one had ever visited that night.
