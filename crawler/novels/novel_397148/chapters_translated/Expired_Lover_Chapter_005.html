Chapter 5 05 Snatching a Cast (Revised)

Morning Star Entertainment is one of the top entertainment companies in China, boasting abundant capital and numerous top-tier celebrities and talented actors.

Enthusiastic fans often camp out at the towering building's entrance, hoping to catch a glimpse of their idols. Every artist who walks through the gates of Morning Star exudes a fervent passion that is captivating.

Bai Tinglin felt a surge of ambition as he walked this road. Since his debut, he had always hoped to one day achieve massive fame, but his career remained lukewarm. Finally, his contract with his previous company expired, and he joined Morning Star Entertainment, only to fade into obscurity once more.

As time went on, his desire grew so intense that when his agent asked if he would be willing to serve Master Liang, he saw it as an opportunity.

Being someone's mistress was one thing; if he wouldn't do it, someone else would. He earned his living with his body.

But who could have imagined that Master Liang showed him absolutely no interest? He'd even been kicked out by Master Liang last night.

After texting Young Master Liang, he was told to come see him today. Bai Tinglin rode the elevator up, his hands and feet ice-cold, his heart pounding, filled with fear.

Upon arriving at Young Master Liang's office, he hesitated for a long time before knocking on Liang Yize's door. Finding it ajar, he gently pushed it open and went inside.

As Bai Tinglin entered, he immediately bowed and greeted, "Young Master Liang, hello."

No one answered. He looked up and saw the man staring at him with a somewhat gloomy gaze. "My brother kicked you out."

"Yes, yes, Young Master Liang."

Liang Yize was wearing a designer long white shirt and black trousers today. Except for his eyebrows and eyes, Liang Yize looked nothing like his father. He had medium-length, slightly wavy brown hair, curled eyelashes, and a somewhat baby-faced appearance, which made him look very delicate and aristocratic.

Bai Tinglin remembered the rumors that he was the son of Liang's uncle's mistress, and that he resembled his mother, making him unacceptable within the family. It was Liang's father who gave him the job at Morning Star.

“What a piece of trash,” he sneered, then turned and asked, “My brother didn’t touch you?”

“No,” Bai Tinglin lowered his head. “Master Liang kicked me out.”

“Not even a few times?”

“No.”

“That country bumpkin could get his hands on you, but you can’t.” The man’s face twisted in anger. “I even sent you in, created opportunities for you, and you couldn’t accomplish anything, and you even made my brother angry!”

Bai Tinglin was startled; he feared Liang Yize would retaliate.

He immediately changed the subject, looking aggrieved, "Young Master Liang, Young Master Liang, it's not that I didn't try, I did my best, it's just... it seems Master Liang really likes that Xia Sang, I can't help it."

Upon hearing Xia Sang's name, Liang Yize seemed to calm down again. "Why do you say that?"

Bai Tinglin just wanted to divert the other's attention. Master Liang hadn't even let him into the house a few times, so he didn't know anything about it. He recalled something and said, half-jokingly, "I saw his clothes in the house." Although they were in Robles' doghouse.

Liang Yize's expression was even more gloomy than before, his eyes seeming to burn. "Get out."

"Okay." Bai Tinglin said, quickly heading towards the door.

Just then, a fair-skinned man with almond-shaped eyes emerged from the office break room and called out, "Young Master Liang."

Bai Tinglin couldn't help but turn around to steal a glance. Upon closer inspection, he thought, "Holy crap, isn't that Xiao Lin?"

Bai Tinglin saw Liang Yize pull Xiao Lin close and repeatedly kiss him on the lips. Fine red spots were visible on Xiao Lin's neck, suggesting what had just happened in the break room.

Bai Tinglin quickly closed the door, finding it unbelievable.

Xiao Lin was a child star and the adopted son of a veteran director. Would someone like him do such a thing? Xiao Lin recalled a rumor circulating in the company that he had previously been Liang Ye's mistress. If Xiao Lin could become Young Master Liang's mistress, then the rumor might not be entirely unfounded.

Bai Tinglin immediately understood what Liang Yize's questions meant.

Young Master Liang liked to play around with Liang Ye's mistresses.

Bai Tinglin shuddered, feeling a wave of nausea.

Perverts, these people are really something else.

He, Bai Tinglin, could sell his body, but selling himself to a pervert was a different story.

At this moment, Bai Tinglin deeply doubted whether he was really so determined to sell himself for his career.

He fled in a panic, as if escaping some fear or ferocious beast. At the same time, he thought of Xia Sang, whom he had just pulled out of the situation. He wondered how this young Mr. Liang would deal with him, but he couldn't help him.

After finishing his business, Liang Yize went straight to the Liang Group in the afternoon, arriving at Liang Yiming's office without any hindrance.

As soon as he entered, he called out to Liang Yiming, "Brother, I went to see Xia Sang yesterday, but it didn't go well, so I didn't bring him. Why did you need to bring him back?"

Liang Yize rambled on for a while, then said, "He's just a kid. Brother, you should find someone more mature and intelligent."

"The mature and intelligent one before?" Mr. Liang looked up.

The last one, Bai Tinglin, was clingy and weak like a parasitic plant.

“I just thought you liked this kind,” Liang Yize said with a grin. “Choose another one right now!”

Liang Yiming rubbed his temples, his head aching. “No need. If you don’t have anything else, you can leave. I need to rest by myself.”

“Brother, what’s wrong?”

“I’m fine. Now that you’re back, focus on your work. Don’t keep coming here.”

“Yes.” Liang Yize didn’t dare say anything more and got up to leave.

Liang Yiming sat alone in his office. That familiar, loathsome feeling surged up again, that bone-deep itch crawling out from between his bones. He longed to be hugged; he longed to touch someone.

His hands trembled as he picked up a cigarette, sucking hard as if swallowing something, until his mouth was overflowing with smoke, which burst out.

The more he smoked, the more his brows furrowed. Finally, he couldn't help but slam his fist heavily on the table. One blow wasn't enough; the restlessness in his heart made him pound the table repeatedly, the black leather striking the mahogany surface with a dull thud.

He had clearly improved a lot in the past two years, but these past few days felt like a backlash, causing him immense pain.

The landline phone on the desk rang. After answering, it was the voice of General Secretary Wang, "Mr. Liang, is there anything I can help you with?"

"Hasn't Xia Sang and the others signed yet?" Mr. Liang asked.

“Yes, Mr. Liang. Mr. Xia’s agent turned him down.”

“His agent’s name is Jin Fulai, right?” Mr. Liang suppressed an inexplicable anger.

“Yes.”

“What’s he like?”

“Nothing special.” Secretary Wang considered carefully, “But he’s good to Mr. Xia.”

“Tch, another one without ambition.” Mr. Liang mocked.

Back then, after Xia Sang and Liang Yiming had a relationship, Liang Yiming brought Xia Sang back to the company. He originally planned to arrange for a top-tier agent to manage him, but Xia Sang said he knew an agent in the company.

Liang Yiming could still vividly recall Xia Sang's slightly embarrassed and cautious face as she asked, "Master Liang, I know an agent at Chenxing. Can I choose him?"

As if afraid he would refuse, Xia Sang quickly explained, "He's a very good person. He knows I'm in trouble and even lent me money."

Liang Yiming didn't care what his lover wanted to do.

However, he couldn't understand Xia Sang's thoughts—just an agent, or even a worse agent.

So he let Xia Sang have her way.

Unexpectedly, this insignificant little man was now jumping up and down with Xia Sang, which made Liang Yiming even more irritated, unable to suppress his anger.

He believed he hadn't wronged Xia Sang in any way—resources, living conditions, hospitals…

yet she was repeatedly refusing him. What did it mean?

Did she sense his problem and want to control him?

Liang Yiming's face darkened. Deep down, he vaguely understood that Xia Sang wasn't that kind of person, but days of insomnia and suppressed emotions had tinged his suspicions with malice. After all, human nature is like that.

He hung up the phone and told the general secretary, Wang, to come in directly; he had something to arrange.

The next day, Xia Sang, along with Jin Ge and Xiao Hong, went to the magazine office for a photoshoot. Although it was just for the magazine's internal pages, they arrived at the studio early to wait for their turn.

In the dressing room, the magazine's makeup artist made Xia Sang look beautiful and chatted intimately with her. Xiao Hong chimed in with a smile, and the group seemed to be having a pleasant conversation.

Just before filming was about to begin, a staff member came in and told Xia Sang, "I'm sorry, but your company and our company feel that your image isn't quite suitable for this issue's theme."

The staff member went on and on with compliments, but the gist was that Xia Sang had been replaced.

Jin Ge's phone rang, and after a brief exchange, he angrily hung up.

The company said at the last minute that Xia Sang wasn't suitable and that they had arranged for other artists from the same company to come and leave on their own.

The makeup artist, standing to the side, was also a little embarrassed. Looking at Xia Sang's unusually dramatic themed makeup, she proactively asked, "Teacher Xia, this makeup isn't very natural, and it doesn't feel very comfortable on your face. Let me remove it for you, so you'll feel more comfortable."

Xia Sang had no choice but to sit back down. Before the makeup artist could even begin removing the makeup, the door to the dressing room was pushed open.

"Hello everyone, teachers, this is Tinglin." A man walked in first to greet them, followed by a boy. Xia Sang turned around and saw it was the boy Liang Yiming had hugged last time—he was the one who had replaced Xia Sang.

"This appointment came too late. Please help us with our makeup first, teachers. The photographer is still waiting." The man spoke loudly. The boy who walked in looked at Xia Sang and the others and couldn't help but pause in surprise.

The makeup artist stood by, somewhat conflicted.

Xia Sang stepped in to help, saying, "Could you please give us some makeup remover? This is easy, we can do it ourselves."

Xia Sang handed over a step, and the staff member quickly came forward, leading them to another makeup mirror. "Teacher Bai, please get your makeup done here."

After the two sat down, the agent kept talking incessantly. Xiao Hong was so annoyed by their sarcastic remarks that her hair practically stood on end; she almost looked like a black-haired monster.

Finally, the boy interrupted him.

"Okay, stop talking," Bai Tinglin said, feeling incredibly embarrassed, almost bursting with awkwardness.

This morning, he was quite happy to hear from his agent that General Manager Liang was occasionally allocating resources to him as promised. But when he arrived, he found it was Xia Sang's job.

Both of them had been fired; who looked down on whom? What was there to be proud of?

Having betrayed Xia Sang yesterday, Bai Tinglin was conflicted. Should he remind Xia Sang?

Before he could finish his thought, Xia Sang and the others quickly removed their makeup and left.
