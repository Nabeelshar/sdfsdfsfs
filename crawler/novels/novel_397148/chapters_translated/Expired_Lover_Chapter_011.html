Chapter 30, Episode 11 (Revised)

"What, not even a word?" Liang Yize clicked his tongue. "Truly ill-mannered."

"You!" Jin Fulai was about to comment when Xia Sang pulled him back. "Young Master Liang, you have so much free time. Why don't you go see Grandpa Liang?"

Liang Yize glared at Xia Sang.

His brother had been very busy these past few days, and he hadn't been able to contact him. Grandpa Liang had even told him not to waste his time wandering around looking for him, and to focus on his work.

"What did you say to my brother?"

"I didn't say anything." Xia Sang spread her hands.

It just so happened that Liang Yize had called Grandpa Liang that day, and he was there.

"Fine," Liang Yize chuckled. "I hope you can still laugh later."

After Liang Yize left, Jin Fulai couldn't stand it anymore and said, "Why is this young Mr. Liang targeting you like that? Does Master Liang know?"

This kind of subtle targeting wasn't the first time; it was just that Liang Yize went abroad for further studies last year, and they had a period of peace.

"So what if he knows? He's Master Liang's brother."

The makeup artist, Shanshan, arrived late and apologized as soon as she entered. Xia Sang and the others stopped talking about it. When Xia Sang came out after her makeup and clothes were done, she saw Liang Yize standing next to the director, talking to him.

Once everyone had arrived, the director specially brought Liang Yize to the front and introduced him, "This is our assistant director, Mr. Liang Yize. He was busy earlier, but he's here now. Please get to know him."

Xia Sang, upon hearing this, met Liang Yize's gaze. His expression was like that of a brightly colored spider seeing its prey struggling in its web, unable to move—it was delighted.

He cheerfully said, "Hi everyone, I'm the assistant director of this variety show. Please guide me from now on."

Jin Ge, standing to the side, couldn't help but mutter under his breath, "Crazy."

During filming, Liang Yize didn't come over to provoke them again. He seemed to be working diligently, following behind the director.

After Xia Sang finished taking promotional photos, on her way back, Brother Jin suggested, "Xia Sang, why don't you talk to Master Liang and see if you can stop Liang Yize from causing trouble? We'll be filming for several weeks."

Xia Sang lowered her head and remained silent.

She wasn't confident she could persuade Master Liang. Master Liang didn't like people dwelling on the past, nor did he like watching others fight amongst themselves, so Liang Yize always acted covertly, without any evidence.

In the end, it was always Xia Sang who was being unreasonable and immature.

She had witnessed this kind of tactic before.

Back at the villa, Xia Sang knew Master Liang wouldn't be coming home for dinner again tonight.

Xia Sang sat alone at the dining table, looking at the empty table, eating her food bite by bite.

Butler Liu placed Robles' dog bowl next to Xia Sang's chair. The sight of Robles munching away on his food slightly eased Xia Sang's mood.

Finally, he couldn't help but complain to Robles, "Robbery, your dad's no good, and your dad's brother's even worse. Birds of a feather flock together."

Xia Sang channeled his anger into his appetite and ate heartily.

After finishing his meal, Robles disappeared to play somewhere. Xia Sang sat in the living room eating fruit and watching a movie. It wasn't until the movie ended that he realized he hadn't checked on Robles for a long time.

He called out loudly, "Robbles!" and heard Robles barking from upstairs.

Following the sound, Xia Sang went upstairs to the master bedroom. Pushing open the door, she saw goose feathers scattered everywhere. Robles was excitedly chewing on Liang Yiming's pillow, his body covered in goose feathers.

Seeing this, Xia Sang finally burst into laughter and rushed in to help Robles chase the feathers around the room.

But just 15 minutes earlier, Xia Sang and Robles had been having so much fun.

15 minutes later, the two of them were incredibly timid in front of Liang Yiming.

Xia Sang's face darkened when she saw Liang Yiming open the door. She immediately apologized, "I'm sorry, Mr. Liang, I didn't keep a close eye on Robles."

Robles chimed in, "Woof woof woof."

Xia Sang had planned to play for a while and then clean up, but Mr. Liang, who wasn't home for dinner, came back so early today and caught them red-handed.

"Is that what you call 'not disciplining them'?" They were practically destroying the house together. Having not lived together for so long, Liang Yiming had almost forgotten how much these two could cause when alone.

"What happened? Why are you taking it out on my pillow?" Liang Yiming led the two to the living room and had the maid clean the room.

Xia Sang initially wanted to brush it off, but remembering Jin Ge's words, he hesitated before asking the question: "Master Liang, did you know that CEO Liang is also participating in this variety show?"

"Yes," Liang Yiming replied, sitting on the sofa. "He told me a couple of days ago."

Xia Sang didn't know what to say.

Liang Yiming stared at Xia Sang for a few moments, then asked, "Are you still holding a grudge against him because of that incident?"

Xia Sang wanted to say no, but didn't know where to begin.

Liang Yiming looked directly at Xia Sang. "The problem arose from the seller's delivery arrangements, not your fault. Didn't we already say that?"

"Yes."

"Liang Yize did make a mistake."

"He explained and apologized to me that very night, and he apologized to you the next day too." Liang Yiming frowned. "I think you two can try to understand each other."

A deep sense of powerlessness filled Xia Sang's heart. He could only answer, "Yes."

The night deepened. Xia Sang slept alone in bed, while Liang Yiming was still working in his study. After a while, he picked up his phone and made a call.

"Hello? Brother, what brings you to call me!" Liang Yize exclaimed excitedly, his face flushed.

"It's nothing serious. Didn't you participate in the variety show 'Dear Dad'?"

"Yes, I was just doing my job properly as you suggested."

"Xia Sang is participating too, so look after him."

Liang Yize pouted and threw the pen in his hand onto the carpet.

"Also, don't be so careless."

"Okay, brother." Liang Yize said coquettishly, "Does he still remember that incident? I apologized to him, didn't I?"

"You scared him."

"Alright, I know."

After hanging up the phone, Liang Yize's obedient expression quickly disappeared. "Hmph, you're good at tattling now, but I know my brother best."

Liang Yize seemed to have discovered something amusing, a pleasant aura emanating from his body. “Besides, it’s such a small thing, I don’t need to do it myself.”

He stroked the hair of the person kneeling beneath him. Xiao Lin lifted his flushed face following Liang Yize’s hand. Liang Yize patted Xiao Lin’s flushed face approvingly, then forcefully urged him to serve him.

He hadn’t expected Xiao Lin to be so obedient, doing whatever he was told. After he was satisfied, he sent Xiao Lin out of the office.

Xiao Lin rubbed his sore mouth and went to the restroom to rinse it. After rinsing, he looked up at his disheveled reflection in the mirror. Suddenly, he slapped himself hard. One slap wasn’t enough; he slapped himself several more times. Only then did his eyes brighten, as if he had come to his senses. He left without a word.
