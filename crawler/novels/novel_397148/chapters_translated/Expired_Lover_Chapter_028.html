Chapter 48, Part 28 (Release)

"Mr. Xia, hello." Secretary Wang stood up to greet him.

Mr. Liang and Lin Leman also looked at Xia Sang. Liang Yiming glanced at Lin Leman, frowning, and said, "What brings you here?"

"I heard Mr. Liang came back to visit." Xia Sang noticed Lin Leman's somewhat restrained demeanor. Having been with Mr. Liang for two years, he had also bumped into Miss Lin before, and her attitude towards him hadn't been very pleasant.

“Auntie, you should go back first,” Liang Yiming said to Xia Sang. “Come up to the study to talk.”

Lin Leman smiled but didn’t speak, appearing magnanimous. After the two went upstairs, she asked Secretary Wang, “Who’s in charge of this little starlet now?”

Secretary Wang didn’t answer directly, politely and flawlessly replying, “We all follow Mr. Liang’s arrangements.”

Lin Leman chuckled and didn’t ask further. She knew Secretary Wang’s family was poor and that Liang Yiming had sponsored his education. He was utterly loyal to Liang Yiming, even though she was his aunt; he’d rather offend her than reveal a single detail.

She didn’t want to embarrass herself by asking him. He might not want to curry favor with her, but some people were willing to.

She picked up her handbag, crossed her arms, and reminded him, "Tell Yiming I'm leaving now. I'll wait for him at the airport the day after tomorrow as I'm leaving the country."

With that, she left.

Second floor study of the villa.

Liang Yiming sat on the sofa, looking at the somewhat restrained Xia Sang. "What's wrong? Sit down."

After saying that, Liang Yiming rummaged through the table in front of him for a lighter. Xia Sang sat down next to him and saw Xiao Lin's information on the top shelf.

The official investigation into Xiao Lin's case has now concluded that it was a suicide, and that Xiao Lin concealed his mental health issues.

Although Liang Yize gave him a lot of work and social engagements, there was no real harm done, and the nature of work in the entertainment industry is inherently entertaining.

Since Xiao Lin and Liang Yize's affair was indeed consensual, Liang Yize was ultimately released.

After his release, Xia Sang didn't hear from him anymore, and he stopped working at the company.

It was said that Mr. Liang offered compensation, but because Xiao Lin was also an orphan and his adoptive father was a scoundrel, no one could accept the compensation. In the end, a donation was made to a child protection organization in Xiao Lin's name, hoping to help more injured children.

Liang Yiming finally found a lighter in a corner and wearily lit a cigarette.

His first glance at Xiao Lin's information was also there. He took a deep drag of his cigarette and, to be blunt, didn't have much of an impression of Xiao Lin. The face was somewhat familiar, but there was no deep memory of him; it was ordinary and fleeting.

He exhaled a puff of smoke. He disapproved of Liang Yize's behavior, and while he couldn't truly empathize with Xiao Lin's background, his upbringing made him feel sorry for him.

At the same time, this Xiao Lin reminded him of Xia Sang.

The two were so similar. Would they end up on the same path?

Liang Yiming took another drag and shook his head slightly.

They were still different.

Xia Sang's eyes were always dark and bright, like Robles', Liang Yiming silently assessed.

That's why Xia Sang made him feel so comfortable; that's why he kept him around for so long.

But he seemed to have kept him there for far too long, which is why others assumed he couldn't live without Xia Sang.

Anyone could help him overcome his desires.

It didn't have to be Xia Sang.

He just needed to get used to it himself.

Liang Yiming told himself this as he finished his cigarette and stubbed it out hard in the ashtray.

Looking at Xia Sang, Liang Yiming uttered the words that had been lingering in his heart, "Xia Sang, let's end things."

Xia Sang sat beside Liang Yiming. He had been waiting, waiting for Liang Ye to speak, but when he heard the words, "Xia Sang, let's end things," he thought, he shouldn't have come today. Seeing that kind of sky, he should have gone back.

He shouldn't have come.

Just like seeing dark clouds and needing to take shelter under the eaves, history shouldn't repeat itself.

What was the scene like when he was first dumped? It was just an ordinary day. He was in his car, enjoying the sunset, planning to have dinner with Mr. Liang.

He worked very hard, just wanting to come home as soon as possible.

Dinner hadn't been eaten yet, and the two of them and their dog sat on the sofa to kill time. Just then, Mr. Liang spoke up, "Xia Sang, our agreement is over."

Liang Yiming handed the contract to Xia Sang. "The deadline was yesterday."

Before Xia Sang could even process what he'd just said, Liang Yiming continued, "If you need anything, just let me know. Your grandmother can stay in the hospital; I'll arrange everything. If you can't think of anything now, then tell Secretary Wang when you do."

What was his reaction then?

Silently, he took the agreement in the living room, turning it over and over, searching for the deadline line. He wanted to ask, but didn't know what to ask.

Because the agreement clearly stated that their relationship ended yesterday.

In the end, he only asked one question, "Can I still have dinner here tonight?" His subordinate, Robles, was unaware of what was happening; upon hearing the word "dinner," he barked twice and wagged his tail incessantly.

In the end, he still accompanied Master Liang and Robles to finish that dinner.

He had no memory of what was served, only that after finishing his meal, he quietly left with the agreement.

But now?

"Why?" Xia Sang heard herself ask. Why bring it up before the agreement expired?
