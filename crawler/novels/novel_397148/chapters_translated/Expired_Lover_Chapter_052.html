Chapter 76, Night 51

Liang Yiming pursed his lips, his jawline stiff.

He hated this moment.

Xia Sang, seeing the oppressive atmosphere emanating from him, knew Liang Ye was unhappy.

Liang Ye was such a strong-willed person; Xia Sang didn't know how to speak.

He gripped Liang Ye's hand tightly. "Liang Ye, we're almost there, very soon."

"Yes, yes, it's not far." The young man leading the way also noticed the awkward situation and echoed him.

But halfway there, Liang Yiming slipped and fell. The path was too slippery and narrow; Liang Yiming twisted his ankle.

Everyone gathered around Liang Yiming, asking, "Are you alright? Are you alright?"

Only Qin Lang watched Liang Yiming from outside, beaming with delight. He figured Liang Yiming was probably ready to kill.

But he remained silent. He hadn't spoken much the entire way, partly because Liang Yiming didn't like him getting close, and partly because he felt it was best to let Liang Yiming and Xia Sang be together; why be a third wheel?

"Don't crowd around him, don't touch Master Liang, he doesn't like it," Qin Lang said lazily. "Just leave him to Xia Sang; there aren't many people walking side by side on this road."

Liang Yiming stood up and took a few steps, his feet throbbing with pain. He had to endure it.

But some pain, some paths, how could one bear?

Xia Sang stepped forward, her voice firm, "Grandpa Liang, I'll carry you."

"Can your small frame handle it?" Qin Lang chuckled.

Liang Yiming stiffened, instinctively wanting to refuse.

Xia Sang raised her arms; after working in the mountains for the past two years, she was much stronger than before. "Only ten minutes left, I'm fine."

Liang Yiming didn't speak, a silent refusal.

"Grandpa Liang, we're almost there," Xia Sang said.

Liang Yiming took a deep breath, squeezing out a single word through gritted teeth: "...Okay."

There was no other choice. This was the only option he could find; he agreed.

Liang Yiming felt Xia Sang's hand under his legs; he remembered it feeling stronger than before.

Liang Yiming wrapped his arms around her neck. He couldn't see, he couldn't guess how much time had passed, or how far they had gone.

Time stretched endlessly in the darkness. He lay on top of Xia Sang, feeling her warm, moist breath emanating from her neck and shoulders.

He should have hated his useless state, but strangely, an inexplicable, undeniable sense of security seeped into him with Xia Sang's body heat. His fingers curled, flicking, as if to touch Xia Sang's neck.

Liang Yiming thought he might be having another episode, his mind repeatedly asking, "Xia Sang, what do you want...?"

They should become strangers.

Why didn't Xia Sang complain? Why did she help him?

And why did she still feel a lingering attachment to Xia Sang?

Fifteen minutes later, the group finally arrived at the small courtyard halfway up the mountain.

When they arrived, the door was tightly closed. The young man led everyone to rest and wait in the courtyard.

"Dr. Xue can go up the mountain to gather medicinal herbs now," he explained. "Dr. Xue prefers to use herbs he grows himself, always planting them all over the mountain. He says the herbs from the mountains are more effective; the ones bought outside are all artificially ripened and not as good."

"Dr. Xue is a good doctor, but his temperament is a bit eccentric. When you get there, just agree with whatever Dr. Xue says."

Before they finished speaking, a sprightly old man in simple clothes returned carrying a basket.

“Who’s this, Xiao Hu?” Dr. Xue clearly recognized the young man.

“Dr. Xue, this is someone from out of town who came to see you for treatment.”

Dr. Xue looked at the group suspiciously. “Don’t come here to mess with me. We agreed, if you believe, you’ll be treated; if not, get out. I don’t care if he lives or dies.”

Dr. Xue’s words startled them. The young man named Xiao Hu quickly tried to smooth things over, “Just kidding, just kidding.”

“I’m not kidding. Will you treat me or not?” He looked at them.

Now that they were already here, Liang Yiming said, “Treat him.”

Dr. Xue then went inside and sat down. He waved his hand, and before anyone could say who was coming to treat him, Dr. Xue pointed to Liang Yiming, signaling the patient to come in.

He took Liang Yiming's pulse. "You need to stay for three days, soak in medicinal baths for three days, and have acupuncture for three days, coming back once a week."

"Can it be cured?" Xia Sang stepped forward and asked.

"It won't kill him."

"That's wonderful, Master Liang!" Xia Sang said happily, her voice crisp in Liang Yiming's ears.

After saying that, Doctor Xue took out a long, thin silver needle and waved it in front of Liang Yiming's eyes, even though Liang Yiming couldn't see it. "Boy, do you think I'll stick a needle the size of a palm into your head?" His tone was provocative.

Butler Liu and Qin Lang both looked hesitant.

Doctor Xue chuckled, "If you don't trust me, we'll treat it conservatively. We'll stick needles in your hand for a while and give you medicine." The old man said, picking up Liang Yiming's hand, but Liang Yiming immediately flung it away.

Dr. Xue's face darkened. "What do you mean?"

"No, no, doctor," Xia Sang immediately explained, "My friend reacts strongly when someone touches him suddenly. He gets uncomfortable when others touch him."

"That's not just a physical ailment, it's a psychological one too," Dr. Xue said, his small eyes scanning Liang Yiming up and down. "Sensual."

The atmosphere became awkward.

Qin Lang, seeing Liang Yiming's dark face, couldn't help but chuckle.

"You hold him down, I'll do the bandages," Dr. Xue continued.

Xia Sang nodded; she was happy to cooperate since he could treat her.

After the bandages were applied, since Dr. Xue could only accommodate two people overnight, Liang Yiming and Xia Sang stayed, while the others followed the young man down the mountain, agreeing to return the next day.

The mountain night was so quiet you could hear the rustling of the wind through the leaves and the distant chirping of unknown insects. Dr. Xue's courtyard was small, the smell of earth and herbs mingling in the cool air.

The unfamiliar surroundings, the unfamiliar bed, made Liang Yiming's nerves tense.

He stared blankly at the ceiling, even though there was nothing there.

A rustling sound came from beside him. "Master Liang, can't sleep?" Xia Sang's voice was hoarse from just waking up, very soft, as if afraid of disturbing the silence.

Liang Yiming didn't answer, but the slight turn of his head betrayed his wakefulness.

Xia Sang groped her way to her feet. "Let's go outside and sit for a while. It's better to clear our heads than just lie there."

Xia Sang hadn't expected Liang Yiming to respond, but instead heard a soft "Mmm."

The two groped their way to the courtyard and sat quietly.

Xia Sang led Liang Yiming to sit outside, and they chatted.

Finally, Xia Sang spoke first, her voice cautious: "Master Liang... what does it feel like after you lose your sight?"

Liang Yiming's body tensed almost imperceptibly for a moment.

He had never talked about it in detail with anyone.

Perhaps it was in this secluded mountain area, or perhaps it was because of Xia Sang's concern today, that he actually spoke.

“I can’t sleep night after night. Day and night are both dark. Every day, every minute, every second feels incredibly long, yet time seems to slow down.” He raised his hand and unconsciously waved it in front of his eyes, though he couldn’t see anything. “Sometimes, I feel like something is in the darkness, like something is crawling on my body, but there’s nothing there…like a lunatic.”

He paused here, his jawline tense, as if he were struggling to suppress some kind of physical discomfort. He looked up, his eyes wide open, as if he could still see the starry sky. “Torturous…exhausting.”

After Liang Yiming finished speaking, the room was silent for a few seconds.

Xia Sang’s heart clenched tightly at these words. He could only offer a dry, forced consolation: "Master Liang, just think of it as... just think of it as a long vacation, a forced rest. You've been pushing yourself too hard; your body can't take it."

"Rest?" Liang Yiming's voice carried a hint of sarcasm. "In this way?"

Liang Yiming chuckled, then heard Xia Sang continue, "Because Master Liang, you will definitely get back to your senses."

The unwavering tone stunned Liang Yiming.

During the time he was blind, many people had said the same things to him: you will get better, you will get back to your senses.

But he knew those people were just trying to comfort him, their words tinged with pity, regret, and schadenfreude, a mixture of all sorts of emotions.

“Why? You don’t even know how serious my injuries are. Why are you so sure?”

Why are you so determined, even more determined than me?

Xia Sang looked at Grandpa Liang strangely. “Grandpa Liang, you never used to ask me ‘why’?”

Liang Yiming felt Xia Sang’s breath on his cheek. He turned to face her. “Now I want to know.”

Xia Sang blushed slightly, looking at Grandpa Liang’s face so close to hers. After a moment of silence, she looked up at the sky and slowly said, “Because you are a very, very strong person. Even if you fall down, you will definitely get back up.”

“And if you still can’t get back up?” Liang Yiming asked curiously.

“No way, you’ll stubbornly get up.” Xia Sang couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “I’d rather kill you than have you lying on the ground like a child.”

Xia Sang imagined the scene. “You should first grieve in silence, then meet a benefactor who heals your eyes, the Dragon King returns to his throne, and according to the filming technique, the camera pulls from your feet to your face. You give a wicked smile and defeat everyone who looks down on you now…”

Liang Yiming listened and, for some reason, laughed too. Such unrealistic ideas would have seemed ridiculous to him before, but now he found them fascinating.

"And then?"

"Then your destined heroine—no, male lead—will appear, and you two will join forces, or he'll be your beloved, and you'll help him slap his villainous side in the face, and finally, you'll live happily ever after."

"Destined love?"

"Yes." Xia Sang pouted.

"And you?"

"I'm just cannon fodder, an ex at best. If I ever cause you trouble, you'll be the kind of person who says, 'Someone, drag him out and never let him show his face in X City again.'"

"Heh." Liang Yiming finally couldn't help but chuckle. Xia Sang laughed along, and in the quiet mountain night, their shoulders trembled slightly with laughter, the leaves rustling.

The atmosphere quieted down, and the two sat quietly for a while. Suddenly, Liang Yiming asked, "Xia Sang, are you upset with me?"

"What?"

"Many things."

Xia Sang took a deep breath. Memories of the past flashed through her mind, but she couldn't grasp any of them. Her voice was calm; she followed her emotions and slowly said, "Of course I'm upset, how could I not?" Xia Sang propped herself up with her hands behind her back and slightly raised her head. "No one would be happy to be driven away like that, especially since Grandma had just passed away. But this is also..." "It's my own business..."

Liang Yiming remained silent, turning his face towards Xia Sang. Even though it was pitch black, he could feel Xia Sang's breathing. "I'm sorry."

Xia Sang shook her head, then remembered he couldn't see, and said, "It's all in the past. Actually... I should thank you more. Back then, my grandmother and I really needed help. What you gave me was far more than what I gave." He paused, his voice soft, "Except... you didn't like me, in other ways, you were actually very good to me."

She was grateful to him.

"Was I good to you?" Liang Yiming murmured, as if asking himself. The material things he gave were just a drop in the ocean for him. But Xia Sang gave her youth and her true heart.

Was this a fair exchange?

“It’s good,” Xia Sang said with a sense of relief. “It’s much, much better than many people. I feel quite lucky.”

He and his grandmother, one a little kid and the other an old woman, especially when he was young, Xia Sang couldn’t even remember how many grievances his grandmother had suffered, how many times she had secretly shed tears. Choosing to be a lover was his own choice, entirely his own. He had no choice; back then, it was the fastest way to make money.

Another silence fell. The mountain wind seemed to have picked up, rustling the leaves.

Liang Yiming asked again, finally voicing the question that had been lingering in his mind for so long: “Since… that’s what you think, then why didn’t you come when I had my accident and was lying in the hospital?”

Xia Sang didn’t answer immediately. Time seemed to freeze.

After a long while, Xia Sang spoke slowly and calmly:

"I went."

"But...you didn't see me."
