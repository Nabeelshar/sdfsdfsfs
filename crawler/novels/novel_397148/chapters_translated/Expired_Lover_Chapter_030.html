Chapter 50 The Dream Ends

Xia Sang lay in her apartment for two days, feeling dazed and confused. On the third day, Jin Fulai stormed in, barging in and yelling, "Xia Sang, what are you doing! I can't get through on the phone!"

Before he finished speaking, Brother Jin had already turned and entered Xia Sang's room.

Xia Sang, still sleepy and with her hair all messy, got out of bed. "Brother Jin, what's wrong?"

"What's wrong? Where's your phone? Are you feeling alright?" Jin Fulai checked Xia Sang up and down.

"It's probably out of battery." Xia Sang reached under the covers and, sure enough, found it was dead and the screen was black.

Jin Fulai grabbed Xia Sang's collar. "Xia Sang, tell me, did you break up with Master Liang?"

Xia Sang was shaken by Jin Fulai, instantly sobering up. Her eyes widened, she scratched her head, and smiled ingratiatingly, "Yes, I haven't figured out how to tell you yet."

"Damn it," Jin Fulai said irritably, running his fingers through his hair, "Do you know the company called me and said they're terminating your contract and want you to come to the company this afternoon?"

"What?" Xia Sang was stunned. Master Liang hadn't mentioned this to him.

"I just received the notification, but it was from HR." Jin Fulai was also puzzled. It wasn't the first time they'd broken up, and Master Liang had always handled these matters with Secretary Wang before. Why the sudden change? “I asked Mr. Liang, but he doesn’t seem to be at the company or the group either.”

“Alright, alright, get up quickly.” Jin Fulai pulled back Xia Sang’s blanket. “We’ll find out what’s going on when we get to the company this afternoon.” Jin answered another phone call while rambling on.

Xia Sang got up and saw Jin answer the phone. His expression suddenly froze. He slowly turned around and said something that struck Xia Sang like a thunderbolt, leaving her stunned on the spot.

“Xia Sang, you might not need to go to the company this afternoon. The hospital said they couldn't get through to you by phone and asked me to tell you to come to the hospital immediately. Grandma Xia is in the emergency room, and her condition isn't good.”

Xia Sang and Jin Fulai rushed to the hospital. The hospital director told Xia Sang directly, “Ms. Xia's condition is deteriorating. It's uncertain how long she can hold on, possibly even until tonight.” Then, remembering something, he asked, “Should we contact General Manager Wang? He said we could contact him if anything happens.”

Xia Sang didn't know how to answer; he had been abandoned by Grandpa Liang again.

“No need, I'll contact him. Thank you.” After the doctor left, Xia Sang stood in the corridor outside the emergency room, pacing back and forth.

At this moment, Xia Sang especially wanted to see Grandpa Liang. He first called Liang Yiming, but a cold female voice replied, "The user you dialed is currently unavailable." Immediately afterward, he called the general secretary's phone, but it was also switched off.

"Xia Sang, calm down," Jin Fulai said, supporting Xia Sang's shoulder. "You can't panic."

Xia Sang knew she shouldn't panic, but she couldn't control herself.

Her oxygen-deprived brain made one foolish decision after another. "Brother Jin, I want to go find Grandpa Liang, but he hasn't answered his phone. I want to go to the villa to find him."

The villa area wasn't far from the hospital. It was Liang Yiming who had transferred Xia's grandmother to this private hospital so Xia Sang could take care of her.

“Go ahead, I’ll keep an eye on things for you,” the doctor said, adding that the surgery would take some time. “Go quickly and come back soon.”

Xia Sang immediately took a taxi to the villa to find Liang Yiming, but when he arrived at the gate, he found that none of the maids who usually stood in the front yard were there. He anxiously rang the doorbell, but Radish, who would always run to the door when it rang, remained silent.

He tried entering the password; it unlocked, and the password hadn’t been changed.

But when Xia Sang went inside, the house was empty.

The villa was empty.

What happened? What happened?

Xia Sang couldn’t understand. He felt dizzy and disoriented. He called Butler Liu at the villa.

This time, the villa's butler, Liu, answered the phone. "Hello, Mr. Xia, what's wrong?"

"Uncle Liu, why is no one at the villa?" Xia Sang asked anxiously.

Butler Liu stammered.

"Uncle Liu, please tell me," Xia Sang said.

"Master Liang went abroad on business and transferred us all back to the old house."

"When will he be back?" Xia Sang originally wanted to ask when Master Liang would return, but Butler Liu misunderstood. "We won't be going back to the villa for a while. Master Liang said that the villa will be vacant or sold, and he'll arrange other jobs for us."

Xia Sang's slow-thinking mind finally understood after so many days.

This time, Liang Ye's breakup was real, a clean and decisive one.

It meant he truly wanted nothing more to do with her.

He didn't want her to live with him.

He didn't want her to continue the relationship.

Xia Sang slumped down at the villa's entrance, tears streaming down her face.

He had simply abandoned her.

"Mr. Xia, are you alright? Is something the matter?" The call hadn't ended yet.

"N-nothing," Xia Sang stammered, hanging up without even saying goodbye.

Xia Sang walked to the door; the taxi driver was still waiting for him.

Xia Sang bit his lip, his eyes fixed on his hands gripping his trousers tightly. He remembered the warmth of Grandpa Liang patting his shoulder late at night, comforting him, saying things would get better. But now, none of that mattered.

But he couldn't cry. He still had to take care of Grandma.

He couldn't cry.

From now on, he and Grandpa Liang truly had nothing to do with each other.

He didn't need Grandpa Liang, and he could take care of Grandma.

"Young man, what's wrong?" the driver couldn't help but ask, seeing Xia Sang like this. "Is she heartbroken, or just got scammed?" The driver, taking a moment to cross the street at a traffic light, handed Xia Sang a cigarette. "Hey bro, have one. There are plenty of fish in the sea."

"Will it rain?" Xia Sang blurted out, seemingly out of nowhere. "I see it raining at this time of day in TV dramas."

"The weather forecast says it'll be sunny today, but it's okay, I'll find you some music." The driver played "Happy Breakup," but it was a DJ version—the music was upbeat and pulsating, making the whole car vibrate, lacking any sense of sadness. The song played line by line.

Xia Sang took the cigarette the driver gave her, lit it, and took a puff. The cheap cigarette tasted bitter and unpleasant, yet it helped to suppress the heaviness in her heart.

Let everything go back to where it all began.

At this moment, Meng seemed to truly awaken.

The difference in status could be overcome with desperate effort; he could learn from it.

But if someone can't see the other person, no amount of struggle will help.

Xia Sang had never felt so deeply that Master Liang didn't love her. Perhaps there was a physical dependence, but Master Liang had never truly wanted to know Xia Sang as a person.

Xia Sang quietly gazed at the distant blue sky and white clouds. "The weather forecast was accurate."
