Chapter 79 54 Air (Supplement)

Liang Yiming slightly raised his head. Xia Sang's hot breath was close to his ear. He said, "Xia Sang, come back and be with me."

Xia Sang froze. "Master Liang, what did you say?"

"Master Liang, do you know what you're saying?" Xia Sang couldn't believe what she had heard. What was Master Liang saying?

"I know."

Xia Sang pushed Liang Yiming away. "Master Liang, I think you've made a mistake, I..."

Xia Sang suddenly became speechless.

I...I don't want to go back to how things were before.

Xia Sang's strength suddenly dissipated. He looked quietly at Liang Yiming. Even though he knew Liang Yiming couldn't see now, he still couldn't help but stare into his eyes as he spoke.

“I won’t be your lover anymore.” Xia Sang’s voice sounded a little hoarse.

He brought Master Liang back because he genuinely wanted to help him, for no other reason, but he also had no intention of returning to Master Liang’s side.

“We’re friends.”

“How can things be like before?”

“Master Liang, Grandma is gone. I can’t go back to the way things were.”

“Even money won’t work?”

“No.”

Xia Sang saw Liang Yiming’s brows furrow, and then slowly added, “Even being my boyfriend won’t work?”

Xia Sang was stunned again. Why did Master Liang say that?

Was it because their atmosphere was good now? Was it because he had helped Master Liang today? Is it because Mr. Liang is alone? Is he currently experiencing a low point?

If Mr. Liang doesn't need him, he's just giving him a helping hand right now.

Mr. Liang once said that his future partner would be someone who could help him grow the group.

A boyfriend is just a bargaining chip, a condition for cooperation, given to him by Mr. Liang.

Mr. Liang won't treat him as a real partner.

"Mr. Liang, you don't like me!"

"I do." Liang Yiming.

"I don't like it."

Xia Sang jumped off the bed. "Master Liang, I don't know why you suddenly have this illusion, but I really just wanted to help you. You've helped me so much before… Maybe you don't like me, but the current environment is just making you think you like me."

"You don't like me." Xia Sang looked at Liang Yiming sadly, then realized he couldn't see her now. "Besides, I'm fine here now, I don't want to go back."

With that, Xia Sang ran out. She fled in panic.

Liang Yiming heard Xia Sang's footsteps leaving. He called out, "Xia Sang!" Only a 'bang' of the door slamming shut answered him.

Liang Yiming pounded the bed, took a few deep breaths, and couldn't help but pound it a few more times. The bed frame vibrated slightly, making a sound. Anger surged within Liang Yiming, but it wasn't directed at Xia Sang. He couldn't explain why, he just felt uncomfortable.

He lay back on the bed, recalling the phone call Wang, the general secretary, had given him two days ago.

"Yes, Mr. Xia came back and brought you flowers and a gift." Liang Yiming had been curious since Xia Sang mentioned his visit, so he called Wang to check.

"Where are the things?" Liang Yiming asked, holding his phone.

"They've all been dealt with by HR." Actually, Liang Yiming had already guessed that the flowers had withered and the gift had been given to other clients.

There wasn't a trace.

"Should I forward a copy of the video to you?" Secretary Wang asked tentatively. Although Mr. Liang couldn't see it now, he felt that Mr. Liang might want it.

"Yes," Liang Yiming replied. "How does he look?"

"Mr. Xia looks like he's been caught in the rain, and he seems a little disappointed," Secretary Wang said carefully. In the video, Mr. Xia was indeed a dog that had gotten wet. He couldn't help but feel a pang of pity for him.

Liang Yiming lowered his eyes upon hearing this. Hearing Secretary Wang's words, he immediately understood that Xia Sang must have seen him with that Miss Feng.

That night, he had vaguely guessed something. He wanted to explain, but he didn't know how to begin.

Now, he still didn't know how to begin.

After lying in bed for an unknown amount of time, Liang Yiming heard Xia Sang push open the door and enter. He heard her softly call his name, "Master Liang?"

When he didn't respond, he heard Xia Sang lie down on the folding bed.

After what seemed like an eternity, listening to Xia Sang's calm breathing, Liang Yiming unconsciously murmured, "Is it love, or gratitude?"

The blurred image of Xia Sang from the past gradually became clearer.

Xia Sang asked him if it was love or gratitude. But what about Xia Sang? Did he see him? Did Xia Sang truly love him?

Liang Yiming didn't understand, and dared not ask.

Xia Sang always said he helped him, so did he love him because he was the one who happened to meet her when she was in trouble?

Thinking this, Liang Yiming felt as if the darkness before him had squeezed out all the air from his lungs, making even breathing painful.

The next day, Xia Sang and the others were having breakfast in the courtyard. Xia Sang, who usually slowed down to wait for Liang Yiming, was unusually quick today.

Before Qin Lang could react, she stood up and said, "I'm going out to film today. Mr. Qin, I'm leaving Mr. Liang in your care today." Without waiting for Qin Lang's reply, Xia Sang dashed off.

Qin Lang, still sitting at the table with a fried dough stick in his mouth, watched Xia Sang's retreating figure. "What happened? What's wrong with you guys?"

He looked at the other person present. "Weren't you all fine yesterday, the damsel in distress?" After being here for over half a month, he'd gotten used to being the boss.

“I told him to come back.” Liang Yiming had only eaten a little today, his gloved hands crossed on his lap. “He rejected me.”

“…” Qin Lang quickly swallowed, asking curiously, “What did you say?”

Qin Lang asked this, but he knew in his heart that Liang Yiming wouldn’t say anything nice.

After hearing Liang Yiming’s account, Qin Lang nodded in agreement, saying, “Xia Sang didn’t slap you; that’s because she has high moral character.”

Liang Yiming turned to Qin Lang.

“Don’t glare at me, you can’t see me.” Qin Lang took a sip of soy milk. “What was your relationship with Xia Sang before? And ‘telling you to come back,’ Liang-ye, that’s a bit… pretentious.”

"You need to figure out what Xia Sang wants," Qin Lang's voice softened. The birds outside chirped sweetly, and the wind blew gently. "Liking someone requires respect and care."

"I care about him," Liang Yiming retorted instinctively.

He took care of Xia Sang. He had worked on Xia Sang's future, arranging teachers and resources for him to take things one step at a time, steadily and surely. How could he not care about Xia Sang?

He only wanted him by his side; he had no other demands.

Was he being unreasonable?

Liang Yiming tapped Qin Lang. "Give me a cigarette."

"Smoke less," Qin Lang said, handing him the cigarette pack. Liang Yiming had smoked less while staying with Xia Sang.

The click of the lighter suddenly triggered another memory in Liang Yiming's mind. His mother, Lin Leyao, also loved to smoke. Her cigarettes were long and thin, the black ends squeezing into the ashtray like a black hedgehog.

That hedgehog had appeared countless times in his childhood, always when she was checking his homework.

"With so many teachers assigned to you, how could you skip class? Was it that tutor who instigated you?" Lin Leyao pointed at Liang Yiming then, "Or that psychologist? He's only 16 and already thinks he's all that."

"I just wanted to go out on my own." Back then, he desperately wanted to fight for it. He didn't understand why others could do it but he couldn't. Why was his life's path only illuminated by his mother? He could.

“Mother, I can do it myself.”

“What do you mean, ‘by myself’!” A shrill, piercing voice echoed in Liang Yiming’s ears. “Take off your gloves! After all these years, are you still blaming me?”

“It was just an accident!”

“I love you, I’m doing this for your own good. Isn’t your current excellence thanks to my nurturing?”

“Can’t you see even a little bit of what your mother has done?”

“I’ve arranged such a good path for you, how can you be so ungrateful?”

“I made a small mistake, and you treat me like this.”

“You really are sick.”

Liang Yiming stood there listening to Lin Leyao’s incessant yelling and screaming. She was all claws and teeth, as if she wanted to pounce on him and tear him to pieces.

“I’m moving out.”

“Slap—” His mother lost control again and slapped him.

Some love is about giving, giving unconditionally, obsessively, and forcefully.

The bitter smoke carried away the inexplicable emotions in Liang Yiming's heart, dissipating into the air with the smoke from his mouth.

Liang Yiming took another drag, thinking again about what happened at the market yesterday.

Qin Lang looked at Master Liang and felt that the man's spirits had improved; it seemed that having Xia Sang bring him here was the right decision. Master Liang was back to his domineering CEO persona.

The next second, Qin Lang heard the sound of the door being pulled open.

"I forgot my camera." Xia Sang's voice suddenly appeared behind Qin Lang. Qin Lang turned around and saw that Xia Sang, who had seemed to have left, had returned. Looking down, he saw that the cigarette Liang Ye had been smoking was now lying at his feet. "Liang Yiming!" It almost burned his pants!

Before Qin Lang could finish speaking, Xia Sang, smelling the cigarette, approached. "What are you doing? Are you smoking?"

"Qin Lang is smoking," Liang Yiming said calmly.

Qin Lang: ??? !!!

"Dr. Qin," Xia Sang pursed her lips, "Liang Ye isn't feeling well right now. You shouldn't smoke next to him."

As a doctor, you should be more concerned about your patients' health.

"I..." Qin Lang glared at Liang Yiming, then instantly realized what he'd done and tried to wink at him. "No..."

"Didn't you tell me to care about the other person's feelings?" Liang Yiming said in a voice only Qin Lang could hear. Xia Sang had never wanted him to smoke.

"Liang Yiming, take responsibility for your own actions."

"Double the bonus."

"No." Qin Lang hesitated, struggling. What kind of person would he become in Xia Sang's eyes if he agreed?

"Four times."

If I don't go to hell, who will?

If I don't save Liang Yiming, who will save the bonus?

"This was my oversight." Qin Lang turned to Xia Sang, placed his hands on his chest in deep repentance, and smiled. "I definitely won't do it again next time."

Unless it's eight times the bonus!

Xia Sang watched Qin Lang and Uncle Liang hesitate, seemingly wanting to say something but then realizing something was off about them. In the end, she said nothing, grabbed her camera, and hurried away.

Today she was accompanying Sister Juan and the others to visit impoverished families in the mountains…
