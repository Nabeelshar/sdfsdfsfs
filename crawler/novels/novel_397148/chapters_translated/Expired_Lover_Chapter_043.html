Chapter 67, Section 43: An Old Friend

B City, halfway up a mountain, a villa.

Qin Lang lit incense, its light fragrance filling the room. He said to the man before him, "Master Liang, say something."

The man, dressed in black casual clothes, sat in a wheelchair, his eyes closed. He was still tall, but much thinner than last year.

Qin Lang patted Liang Yiming, but Liang Yiming didn't react at all. "You're really awkward. Let's talk. What are you thinking?"

After a while, Liang Yiming finally said, "I'm fine."

Qin Lang chuckled inwardly, knowing that Liang Yiming was just putting on a brave face.

This year, Liang Yiming's insomnia had worsened to the point where he relied on medication to sleep. He spoke less and less during conversations, and his defensiveness grew stronger.

Moreover, this family—the aunt teaching the young lady to climb into bed, the younger brother climbing into the older brother's bed—they were all crazy.

"Robles was hurt, don't you have any thoughts?" Qin Lang stood up and walked to Liang Yiming's side. "Your younger brother is now on the same side as his father, the shareholders are like fence-sitters, don't you have any thoughts either? Your people betrayed you like this, don't you feel anything?"

Qin Lang looked down and could see the dark circles under Liang Yiming's eyes, the taut jawline revealing sharp lines, making him look somewhat gloomy. "Liang Yiming, what exactly are you thinking?"

What was he thinking? Liang Yiming looked up into the darkness, the heavy breathing of Qin Lang filling his ears. He'd never noticed it before in his twenty-odd years; he realized how loud human breathing could be.

It was so loud it kept him awake. Not just breathing, but also footsteps, conversation, laughter, even the sound of time tearing at his skin.

Liang Yiming, sitting in his wheelchair, slightly raised his head. His lips were flat, his gaze unfocused as he found Qin Lang's location. He slowly spoke, "I don't have any intentions."

Qin Lang was enraged by those words. Defense, still defense. He had tried to coax him gently, but Liang Yiming was like a clam shell; he stubbornly refused to tell the truth.

He pointed at Liang Yiming, "Liang Yiming, you're such a damn fake."

"Not saying anything doesn't mean it's over... I'm your therapist. Keeping your thoughts hidden from me like this won't do your job. Do you understand? I know you can tough it out. Even grass can eventually crush a camel. Dragging it out isn't the solution, do you understand..." Qin Lang's mouth was dry, feeling like he was about to explode with anger. "The result of this is harming others, like Robles..."

Finally, Qin Lang saw Liang Yiming's breathing quicken. For a moment, his hand on the wheelchair handle tightened, his head lowered slightly, as if he didn't want anyone to see what was going on, but the veins on his forehead bulged slightly.

The atmosphere in the room was deathly silent, as if the air had frozen.

Qin Lang took a step forward and suddenly reached out to Liang Yiming. Before he could even reach Liang Yiming, Liang Yiming had already steered his wheelchair back a step.

His eyes couldn't see, yet he could still sense and avoid the movement—meaning the other's tense nerves hadn't relaxed for a single moment.

Qin Lang withdrew his probing hand. "Fine, okay, you don't have to like me. But you really need someone to take care of you, you need to accept that."

Qin Lang sat back down on the sofa opposite Liang Yiming. "That Xia Sang from before, didn't you like someone else? I heard that General Manager Wang contacted Xia Sang? How did it go? Did he agree? By the way, did you ask General Manager Wang to contact her…?" Qin Lang relaxed his shoulders and continued.

"It's not liking, just a crush," Liang Yiming replied.

Qin Lang's brow twitched, feigning nonchalance, "Fine, then don't let Xia Sang come back. Whoever lets him back is a dog."

Just then, a knock came at the door. It was Chief Secretary Wang.

Chief Secretary Wang entered, nodding to Liang Yiming and Qin Lang, "Mr. Liang, Mr. Xia said he's coming to see Robles in a couple of days. He asked if you have time; he'd like to visit you too."

...
On the plane, Xia Sang looked out at the thick, chaotic clouds. The slight unease he felt in mid-air made him even more anxious. His mind was unsettled, his brow furrowing unconsciously as he tried to calm himself.

But he couldn't help wondering what B City was like now.

Xiao Hong sat beside Xia Sang, watching a movie she'd downloaded earlier on her tablet. As she opened it, she said, "Xia-ge, don't think about it. Let's just treat this as a family visit. Can anyone stop you from leaving? When we get back, let's have hot pot with Jin-ge first. His new artist is doing really well lately; he's got money now, we have to rip him off."

Xiao Hong chattered on and on for several hours.

After getting off the plane, Xiao Hong continued chattering, pulling Xia Sang along, "Xia-ge, when you come back, I'll take you to all the popular tourist spots in B City. There are so many new fun places lately… the place I told you about last time, and…"

Xia Sang was almost dizzy from Xiao Hong's rambling.

Looking up blankly, he saw a chubby figure standing at the airport entrance. Xia Sang's nose stung; she felt a mix of laughter and tears. She'd told Jin Ge to lose weight, but it seemed to have no effect whatsoever.

Xia Sang couldn't help but pout. "Jin Ge hasn't lost any weight at all." He'd actually gained weight.

Xiao Hong put her hands on her hips. "Exactly! I told him he'd gained weight, but he didn't believe me, saying I had vision problems."

Jin Fulai saw the two of them huddled together, seemingly talking. Looking at them again, he felt a tightness in his chest. He walked over and hugged Xia Sang tightly. "You're finally back! It's been so long!"

Xia Sang was both amused and exasperated. "Jin Ge, didn't we see each other during the New Year?"

"That was when we flew over to see you! And you..." "Would it be the same if you flew back!" Jin Fulai scoffed. "Alright, give me the luggage."

Jin Fulai pulled the luggage and led Xia Sang and the others to the parking lot. "Let's have dinner together tonight, and I'll take you to see Grandpa Liang tomorrow."

As they walked, Jin Fulai stopped and looked Xia Sang closely. "You look thinner."

"No."

"You definitely are. You've only been back a few days. I'll make you something nourishing."

"Okay." Xia Sang said with a smile.

...

On the way to Xiao Hong's house, Brother Jin said, "Ziyi was recently scammed and got some negative press, so we're having dinner at Xiao Hong's. Later, I'll treat you to a fancy hotel."

Ziyi, Brother Jin's new protégé, is said to be a very talented actress, a gem Brother Jin discovered at the film studio. She recently landed a wildly popular supporting role, but was unfairly targeted by co-stars. Luckily, her PR was quick, and the storm passed. However, seeing how protective Brother Jin is of her, he's worried someone might cause trouble again.

Xia Sang smiled and nodded, looking out the car window. Some tall buildings still stood, gleaming in the sunlight; some high-rises and low-rises had new signs and fresh paint; others had been demolished and enclosed with corrugated iron sheets. Even the buildings were changing.

As they passed a shopping mall, Xia Sang stopped at a red light. Looking up, she saw an advertisement for a male celebrity's perfume playing on the mall's billboard, with the name "Brand Ambassador of XX Series" displayed below.

Xia Sang squinted, trying to make out the celebrity's name. He looked vaguely familiar.

Jin Ge, noticing Xia Sang looking in that direction, also looked up. "What are you looking at?"

Jin Fulai looked up and exclaimed, "Oh, it's him! Fate brings us together again!"

"Bai Tinglin, you remember him, right? Ever since that Xiao Lin incident, he's been much more well-behaved. He's been working with several film crews, taking small supporting roles one by one, honing his acting skills. Recently, one of his supporting roles in that drama became a huge hit, and his resources have improved."

The light turned green, and Jin Fulai started the car, quickly passing the billboard.

Xia Sang listened, a sigh escaping his lips, a smile spreading across his face. People could change so much.

In that instant, Xia Sang unconsciously thought of Master Liang.

The last time he saw Master Liang, the template of him, flashed through his mind. He wondered how Master Liang was doing now.

He unconsciously gripped his trousers tighter…
