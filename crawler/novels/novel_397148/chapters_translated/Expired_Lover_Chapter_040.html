Chapter 60: 40 Departure (Bonus Chapter)

Xia Sang returned to City B alone, without telling anyone.

He didn't know if coming here was the right thing to do.

With Liang Ye's status, if anything happened, someone would surely take care of it for him—money, hospitals, caregivers, and even the Chief Secretary Wang and his team were all elite talents.

What use was going there alone?

Thinking this, Xia Sang sighed. No matter how much he tried to convince himself, he was already back in City B. He didn't even dare tell Brother Jin and the others, afraid they would worry and also ashamed to speak up.

He had previously replied to Brother Jin, "Let's see." But he still came back. He absolutely couldn't let Brother Jin know; he would laugh at him.

Xia Sang was unaware of the worry and inner turmoil on his face.

“I’ll just go take a look,” Xia Sang told herself. “If someone is taking care of Grandpa Liang, I’ll go.”

Xia Sang hailed a taxi at the door. She had the address of Grandpa Liang’s hospital online; it was the hospital her grandmother used to stay at.

On the way, Xia Sang wondered if going empty-handed would be inappropriate. She got out halfway and bought a bouquet of flowers and a gift.

Back in the car, Xia Sang rubbed the edge of her phone. Grandpa Liang’s number was on it; she was hesitating whether to call.

Her tone of refusal had been so harsh before; now she felt really embarrassed to call.

Xia Sang hesitated again and again. “Never mind, I’ll see when I see him.”

The car drove all the way to the hospital. From afar, Xia Sang saw many reporters gathered at the hospital entrance. Startled, she reflexively pulled her mask up high.

Then it dawned on him. So many new faces emerge in the entertainment industry every day; he'd been retired for over a month, and he was dressed so simply—no one recognized him at the airport.

"Sir, slow down, look ahead."

Several tall bodyguards in black were blocking reporters trying to squeeze in for interviews. Secretary Wang and two caregivers, holding umbrellas, escorted Liang Yiming out of the hospital.

Flashlights blared around them.

Seeing Secretary Wang protecting Mr. Liang, Xia Sang called out, "Make way, please use official channels for formal responses."

Mr. Liang and the others got into the car and were about to drive away. Xia Sang quickly asked, "Driver, can you keep up with the car in front?"

The taxi driver looked at Xia Sang suspiciously. Her face wasn't visible behind a mask; what did she do?

"I'll pay extra," Xia Sang added.

"Okay, sit tight, I'll follow right away," the driver cheerfully turned on the meter. How bad could someone who'd pay extra be?

Xia Sang wasn't the only one wanting to follow; some other drivers were also following at a leisurely pace.

Although annoying, they maintained a safe distance and couldn't be easily shooed away.

Xia Sang followed like this until the car reached the edge of the city and stopped in another grove of trees—the Liang family's old house.

The cars were all parked outside the iron fence, and Mr. Liang's car gradually drove away.

"Young man, we can't go in here," the driver asked. "Shall we turn around or what?"

Xia Sang looked at the spacious garden. "I'll get out and take a look."

The sky was overcast, and a light drizzle was falling.

"It's raining," the driver said. "How about I lend you my umbrella?" Xia Sang's fare alone was enough for the driver to earn his entire day's wages, and besides, there were no taxis around here. Xia Sang figured he'd have to ride back with him, so the driver became more friendly.

"Thank you." Xia Sang took the driver's umbrella and opened it to reveal the large sign for XX Bank.

Xia Sang looked at the tall building, unsure of what to feel.

He had never been here before. Perhaps Grandpa Liang stayed here during those days when he didn't return to the villa.

He had never heard Grandpa Liang mention it.

This place seemed like another world.

Xia Sang got out of the car and stepped onto the grass, walking around the iron fence for more than ten minutes until he actually saw Grandpa Liang.

He stood on tiptoe and peered inside.

It was the lawn in front of the garage. Grandpa Liang was quite far away. Xia Sang looked at Grandpa Liang; he hadn't seen him clearly before, but now he saw him wearing unusual casual clothes, holding his head as if he wasn't feeling well. Everyone seemed to be waiting for him to calm down.

Xia Sang had been watching intently when suddenly he saw Master Liang turn his head slightly, his gaze fixed on Xia Sang. Startled, Xia Sang gave an embarrassed smile and involuntarily raised his hand to wave at Master Liang.

Did Master Liang see me?

But he remained calmly watching.

Liang Yiming's unusual behavior attracted the attention of others. Xia Sang, for some reason, crouched down and hid, feeling worried. Was it inappropriate for him to follow them to the old house like this?

He hesitated.

When he stood up again, several more people had appeared in the garage.

Lin Leman, the butler, and a beautiful, gentle-looking girl in a pink suit were beside Lin Leman.

Butler Liu had initially intended to take over pushing Master Liang's wheelchair, but then saw Lin Leman speak to him and place the girl's hand on the armrest of Liang Yiming's wheelchair.

Butler Liu stood behind, holding an umbrella.

Master Liang accepted. Xia Sang thought.

Xia Sang watched as the rain intensified, the damp mist and splashing water soaking her.

Great, Master Liang is being taken care of.

Xia Sang returned to the car, somewhat disheveled.

The taxi driver was startled. "Where did she go?" He had seen Xia Sang had been gone for a while and was worried something had happened.

"It's nothing, it's just raining harder." Xia Sang forced a smile, picking up the bouquet and gift. "Please wait a little longer."

"Okay, okay."

This was the fifth time Xia Sang had sent flowers to Master Liang.

Unfortunately, she hadn't managed to get them to him.

The security guard at the old mansion's gate didn't recognize Xia Sang, mistaking him for a reporter lingering at the entrance, and directly chased him away.

Accepting the gifts was even more out of the question; who knew what was inside?

Xia Sang could only take the flowers and gift to the front desk of the Liang Group company. A quick glance revealed a densely packed stack of flowers and gifts behind the counter.

"Hello, may I ask which company you're from? You can register and sign your name; we'll submit the list to our superiors. Thank you for your concern," the receptionist greeted her with a smile.

Xia Sang hesitated for a moment, then said, "No need, it's just a personal gesture; the thought is what counts."

The receptionist, not wanting to be too insistent, smiled and nodded, taking the flowers and gift.

Xia Sang's bouquet of red carnations wasn't the largest or the most beautiful; it was just an ordinary bouquet.

The receptionist placed it into the crowded pile of flowers. It was almost impossible to find.

After thanking her, Xia Sang left.

He returned to the airport and waited for the next flight to G City.

He had quietly come here alone, and quietly left again.

Afternoon, Liang Group reception area.

The company administrator came down to take inventory, looking at the flowers and gifts scattered on the floor. "So many people have brought gifts again, are they all signed?"

The receptionist replied, "I asked, some have, some don't."

"Okay, give me the list. They said to register the gifts and put them in the warehouse." The administrator pointed to the bouquets, "As for the flowers, pick some to decorate the break room, and whoever likes the rest can take them."

"Okay," the receptionist said happily with a smile.
