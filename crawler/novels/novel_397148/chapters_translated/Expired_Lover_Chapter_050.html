Chapter 74, 49 Big Yellow

Xia Sang carried breakfast back. "Grandpa Liang, Dr. Qin said you're currently unemployed, so he suggested I take you around."

Liang Yiming, holding the bread Aunt Huang had made, nodded casually.

Assistant Wang was still at the company. Unless there were special circumstances, he would contact Liang Yiming by phone in the evenings.

During the day, Liang Yiming would pass the time listening to audiobooks.

As Xia Sang was about to leave, she reached for the wheelchair handles and then it dawned on her. Grandpa Liang had been in a wheelchair since their first meeting, but he had stood while showering last night and washing up this morning, so his legs were fine.

He could clearly walk with a cane, yet he remained in a wheelchair.

Something must have happened.

Xia Sang looked down and saw Liang Yiming's head—smooth, black hair with a small whorl.

A lot had happened to Grandpa Liang this past year.

Xia Sang silently pushed the wheelchair, trying to keep it on the smooth path, but the village was nothing like the city, and she could still feel the bumps.

"Xia Sang, who is this?" some passing villagers asked with smiles. Only a few strangers came to the village each year, and many villagers looked on curiously.

“He’s my former boss.”

“A big boss.” Although Xia Sang was usually very low-key, many people knew about his donations to the village. Everyone in the village considered Xia Sang to be well-off, and now that Boss Xia Sang was here, he was even more valuable. However, Liang Yiming seemed rather cold and kept his eyes closed, not saying a word. After a few words of shoving and pushing, the group hurriedly left.

Xia Sang continued pushing Grandpa Liang, preparing to visit the village's poverty alleviation e-commerce office.

Liang Yiming endured the bumpy journey. Along the way, he heard many people greeting Xia Sang. He hadn't expected that in just one year, Xia Sang seemed to have completely changed.

Xia Sang kept trying to keep him quiet the whole way, her voice quite loud, but the gentle breeze blowing through the woods made it seem less bothersome.

At that moment, Liang Yiming unconsciously relaxed in the sound of her voice.

He wouldn't stay in the village long; once the mole in the company was caught, he would return.

Perhaps he should take Xia Sang back with him.

He didn't dislike Xia Sang's presence, nor her voice; she was the most suitable person to take care of him.

But how?

Liang Yiming began to ponder this question.

Xia Sang wasn't his employee, had no sick relatives, and wasn't even short of money…

He had no weaknesses.

Liang Yiming suddenly realized that without using his power, he had no leverage to control Xia Sang.

Liang Yiming lowered his eyebrows, his face grim.

Just then, he heard the young man's voice again—"Xia Sang, you're here."

He also heard Xia Sang call out to that man—"An Yang."

Liang Yiming unconsciously gripped the handle. The man sounded to be about Xia Sang's age, and their tone of voice sounded familiar.

What was their relationship?

Throughout this journey, Liang Yiming had been constantly getting to know new people. These were Xia Sang's new friends, her new life.

Life without him.

Even with Xia Sang standing beside him, Liang Yiming still felt that Xia Sang was no longer the person waiting for him in the villa.

Liang Yiming was suddenly feeling irritated again; the noise was too much.

That night, after Xia Sang helped Liang Yiming wash up, she helped him sit up on the edge of the bed, just like yesterday. "Grandpa Liang, sit down. I've prepared something for you."

Liang Yiming was a little confused; Xia Sang had prepared something for him.

Xia Sang opened the door and dragged something in.

Soon, he had a living creature in his arms—his mongrel dog named Da Huang.

"Grandpa Liang, I heard from Dr. Qin," Xia Sang said, "Grandpa Liang, you need something to comfort you to sleep well."

"Don't worry, I've cleaned Xiao Huang up!" Xia Sang placed Xiao Huang in Liang Yiming's arms. “…” Liang Yiming, “What did Qin Lang say to you?”

“He said you’re afraid of the dark.”

“…” At this moment, Liang Yiming was already plotting how to deduct Qin Lang’s wages.

Xia Sang kept pulling at his blanket, trying to put the mongrel dog inside.

“I don’t need it.”

Xia Sang’s hands and feet didn’t stop. “You do need it. I’ve already washed Da Huang clean, trimmed its nails, and brushed its teeth. It’s very clean.”

Xia Sang pressed down hard on Liang Yiming’s hand. “Grandpa Liang, don’t be afraid to see a doctor. Da Huang actually looks a lot like Radish.”

One is a golden retriever, the other a Chinese rural dog. They look nothing alike; even the length of their fur is different.

“They’re all dogs.”

Liang Yiming, for the first time in a long time, felt the urge to throw both the dogs and the people out. He raised his hand, pointing to where Xia Sang had made the sound, and was about to speak when he heard a “thud,” and something unfolded beside his bed.

“What are you doing now?” Surely he couldn’t be making a doghouse again, could he? Liang Yiming wondered.

Hearing Xia Sang move something to the side, he said, “Master Liang, you can sleep now, I’ll be right next to you.”

Xia Sang placed a folding bed next to Liang Yiming.

Hearing Xia Sang say this, Liang Yiming felt a surge of heat. He asked, "Why are you sleeping here?"

Xia Sang was silent for a moment before answering, "I... I'm afraid you and Da Huang will fight."

"..." Liang Yiming, "Xia Sang, get out of here right now with this dog."

"I won't." After saying that, Xia Sang didn't say anything more. Liang Yiming only heard the sound of him patting the blankets beside him, rustling as he adjusted his position for a while before hearing Xia Sang's voice again.

"Goodnight, Master Liang. Sweet dreams. Call me if you need anything."

Finally, "Master Liang, I'm always here."

As she spoke, the restless dog jumped on the bed.

Liang Yiming remained silent, lying quietly on the bed. After some time, he heard soft breathing beside him; Xia Sang had fallen asleep.

He called softly, "Xia Sang."

He reached out and touched Xia Sang's blanket. He slowly groped along the blanket and found her hand. He gently squeezed it and pulled it up, a sense of peace washing over him.

If Xia Sang was there, she would know if anyone approached him.

Now it was darkness, but not only him, but also Xia Sang.

The next day, Liang Yiming woke up, ate breakfast, and while Xia Sang left to clear the dishes, he picked up his phone and made a call. "Qin Lang, you're finished for leaking patient information."

"Damn it, Liang Yiming, you didn't say anything about your illness!! You're so ungrateful!!" Qin Lang accused. "Wasn't I just creating an opportunity for you?"

Then, Qin Lang said slyly, "Did Xia Sang sleep with you?"

Liang Yiming thought about how he touched the dog's butt next to his face when he woke up that morning, and the veins on his forehead throbbed. "Get lost!"

...
Two days later, Liang Yiming was already familiar with the way to the office.

Today, when Xia Sang was being helped, the first voice he heard wasn't that of the boy named Chen Anyang, but a woman, who sounded to be around thirty years old.

The woman's voice was cheerful, "Xia, you're here! Wow, you guys did a great job!"

Then came Xia Sang's happy voice, "Sister Juan! You're back!"

Sister Juan—Liang Yiming had heard this name from Xia Sang many times before, always with great enthusiasm.

Who was this person, and what was her relationship with Xia Sang?

Liang Yiming noticed that since he came to this village, Xia Sang had been surrounded by more and more people.

This Xia Sang was somewhat unfamiliar to him; the Xia Sang he knew wasn't like this.
