Chapter 6 06 Three Stooges (Revised)

In the car, Xiao Hong crossed her arms and said, "I'm still so angry! If you were still with Master Liang, they'd dare bully you!"

"Xiao Hong..." Xia Sang paused, his hand hovering over his phone. He thought for a moment, wondering how to tell Xiao Hong that they really had the guts to bully them. "Jin Ge and I saw Master Liang taking that guy into a hotel and to a party a couple of days ago."

"Master Liang and him?"

Xia Sang nodded.

Xiao Hong was taken aback: "Master Liang's taste changes so quickly."

It's no wonder Xiao Hong was surprised. Xia Sang's style was that of a cheerful and handsome boy next door, while Bai Tinglin looked gay at first glance, all flamboyant and lewd.

Xiao Hong imagined the scene of Uncle Liang embracing Bai Tinglin and couldn't help but frown.

She felt something was off about it, and nothing compared to Xia Ge's handsome figure!

Back at Xia Sang's apartment, Xiao Hong still couldn't figure it out. "What does Uncle Liang see in him?"

"How could you possibly guess what he likes?" Brother Jin came in, ordering takeout for everyone. "What would you like to eat?"

Xia Sang, who had only been drinking porridge for the photography shoot, was starving and ate whatever was high in calories.

With nothing else to do, Xiao Hong went into the bathroom and casually checked Xia Sang's skincare products to see if he needed any replenishment.

Xia Sang knew nothing about beauty products; Xiao Hong bought them all for him.

Xiao Hong looked at each item one by one and asked, "Brother Xia, this hand cream, lotion, and scrub are almost gone. Do you still want to buy them?"

Xia Sang was taken aback.

Xiao Hong had been wondering what it was about Bai Tinglin that attracted Master Liang.

He recalled Bai Tinglin's appearance: fair skin, slender figure, and a soft, delicate look.

That was probably the kind of person Master Liang wanted him to be.

Bai Tinglin was exactly Master Liang's type.

He only realized much later that Master Liang actually really, really liked being hugged and touched; the touch between their chests would send shivers down their spines. But there had to be a distance; you had to wait for him to touch you first, not the other way around.

So, soft, comfortable skin was what Grandpa Liang liked most.

The thing he touched most often was Grandpa Liang's hands; he would stroke Grandpa Liang's face, neck, and back. For a while, Grandpa Liang really enjoyed this activity.

One day, Grandpa Liang had his assistant send him a lot of skincare products, all very fragrant. He figured it was because his hands weren't very smooth from his earlier work.

He roughly understood what Grandpa Liang meant, so he asked Xiao Hong to buy him a lot of these.

Over the past two years, the calluses on his own hands had indeed gradually disappeared due to the nourishment.

"If you're out, just buy some more," Xia Sang replied.

After they finished eating, Xia Sang saw them out.

"Alright, get some rest. You have work tomorrow." Jin Fulai asked several people in the company, but none of them had heard anything about it. He wasn't sure if this was an accident or intentional; he could only wait and see.

Unexpectedly, several announcements changed in succession over the next few days. Some were replaced, some involved breach of contract and fines, and others reneged on their contracts…

"Sorry, we have a more suitable candidate."

"This company wants to try a different spokesperson, and we won't renew the contract when it expires."

…
"You have no sense of contractual obligation!" Jin Fulai was so anxious that he had blisters on his lips; his pent-up anger finally exploded.

The other end didn't respond and hung up immediately.

“We're never working with them again!”

Xia Sang felt a pang of sadness seeing Jin Fulai's anxious expression.

“Are we still going to our shoot this afternoon?” Xiao Hong asked.

“If we haven't been notified, we'll go. We definitely have to follow orders,” Jin Ge waved wearily. “You and Xia Sang go this afternoon. I'll go find a friend.”

“Okay,” Xiao Hong replied.

When they arrived at the filming location that afternoon, they said Xia Sang's image didn't fit their theme and they needed to replace her.

Xiao Hong wanted to argue, but Xia Sang remained silent and pulled Xiao Hong away.

Seeing Xia Sang's low spirits, Xiao Hong wanted to say something comforting, but the words caught in her throat.

The two walked to the outside and saw a car parked by the driveway.

Xia Sang recognized the license plate—it was Liang Ye's car.

Thinking about the events of the past few days, Xia Sang was unusually angry.

He wasn't angry that someone had stolen his gig; he was angry that Liang Yiming had targeted and taken it away for no reason.

Liang Yiming had explicitly told him to leave, and now he was pulling these dirty tricks behind his back!

He couldn't understand what Liang Yiming was trying to do.

Which rumor had come from that he was easy to please and would be very respectable after his contract expired?

Why did he seem difficult to please during the contract period, and now that it was over, he was still causing him trouble?

From a distance, Liang Ye's car looked colder and more aloof than everyone else's cars.

Seeing Xia Sang staring intently at Liang Yiming's luxury car, Xiao Hong felt a pang of worry. Afraid Xia Sang might act impulsively, he pulled her back, saying, "Let's go back first."

Xia Sang pushed Xiao Hong's hand away. "It's alright. I'll go over for a bit. Wait for me here."

Xia Sang walked over and waved towards the car window. Liang Yiming, habitually sitting on the right side of the back seat, waited for a while, but the window remained motionless.

The summer sun was blazing, and Xia Sang was sweating profusely.

"Mr. Liang, Mr. Xia," the driver reminded her.

"Hmm," Mr. Liang replied, but didn't move.

Seeing Liang Yiming staring at Xia Sang without speaking or moving, the driver naturally didn't dare to say anything more.

Xia Sang knocked on the rear window again, but there was still no response.

No one's here?

Xia Sang moved closer, pressing his face against the window, but couldn't see anything clearly. As he moved closer, the window suddenly rolled down, and Xia Sang's eyes met Liang Yiming's.

His eyes, behind his frameless glasses, gleamed with coldness. His strong, muscular physique, even in a well-tailored suit, exuded undeniable sex appeal, and his intense hormones made one's mouth dry in the summer heat.

Xia Sang abruptly took a step back, awkwardly chuckling a few times. Inwardly, he cursed, "This guy's clearly in the car; he deliberately made me stand here, holding a grudge! Taking revenge! Insidious and treacherous!"

Xia Sang took out all the idioms she knew and recited them to Liang Yiming.

Just as Xia Sang was getting into her tirade, Master Liang raised an eyebrow and said, "Don't curse me in your heart."

Xia Sang visibly flinched, looking guilty.

This reaction immediately amused Liang Yiming. His probing had revealed everything. So why wouldn't he renew the contract?

Liang Yiming was curious but didn't speak, looking up to see Xia Sang's reaction.

After her initial embarrassment, Xia Sang realized that even if she cursed Master Liang, so what? He wasn't his lover anymore. Xia Sang straightened her back and said bluntly, "Master Liang, why are you making trouble for me?"

Xia Sang wasn't afraid of angering Master Liang. She had been with him for two years and knew his temperament well enough that he wouldn't hold it against her. "I can't afford to bother you?" Liang Yiming smiled at Xia Sang.

"Of course you can, but didn't we end things peacefully? It doesn't have to be this irreconcilable!" Why should a busy man like Master Liang concern himself with the affairs of a nobody like him?

"What do you think?" Master Liang retorted.

"Definitely not!" Xia Sang replied firmly, deflecting his former boss's doubts. "I'm very obedient."

He had listened to Master Liang in everything during his employment. Being subtly rejected was a sign of his intelligence. What grudge could he possibly hold against Master Liang?

Even a lover would give him a Best Employee award at the end of the year.

Master Liang didn't answer.

"Master Liang, do you want me back?" After several days of actions, Xia Sang couldn't possibly be completely oblivious to Liang Yiming's meaning.

"Then what do you think?"

In Liang Yiming's mind, he had already given Xia Sang a way out. But Xia Sang seemed not to have grasped it, her face full of struggle, finally asking, "Master Liang, do you need me?"

Xia Sang looked at Master Liang and repeated, "Do you need me?"

Because, if it weren't necessary for him, why would he rush in and get hurt himself?

That night, the conversation between Liang Yiming and Liang Yize was still vivid in his mind—"I won't be with him. My future partner must be someone who can contribute to the group's development."

Since he was just an ordinary person, he should find his place, live a good life, work hard, and not think about unrealistic things or dream of reaching the top.

Xia Sang told himself this in his heart, but he didn't realize how brightly his eyes were looking at Master Liang, as if waiting for an answer he dared not imagine.

But Liang Yiming seemed very dissatisfied with this. He frowned, turned his gaze back to the tablet in his hands, and said coldly, "Drive." As Master Liang spoke, the car window slowly rolled up.

Xia Sang stood there, unsure of what to do.

Did he say something wrong? Should he try to persuade him to stay? And if so, what right did he have to try? Xia Sang himself was confused; he hesitated, and felt lost.

He thought that at least he and Master Liang had parted amicably, that at least they could meet someday and somewhere and have a chance to sit down and talk. He could tell Master Liang about his progress.

Xia Sang watched Master Liang's car drive away and disappear at the end of the road.

Xiao Hong rushed over, anxiously asking, "Brother Xia, are you alright?"

Xia Sang turned his head and scratched his head lightly, "I should be fine..." But if Brother Jin found out, he would definitely scold him.

"I knew it! You two, you can cause trouble the moment I'm not around!" Brother Jin paced back and forth in the office like a little old man, "We can't just sit here and wait to die!"

"Yes, yes, yes," Xia Sang and Xiao Hong nodded in agreement.

Jin Fulai pulled a small booklet from a drawer, slapped it hard in his hand until his palm turned red, and exclaimed, "I consulted a friend! It doesn't matter if we can't be stars, we can be internet celebrities!"

Then, Jin Fulai offered his insightful advice on "looking for a better opportunity while still having options," leaving Xia Sang and Xiao Hong stunned. "Now, many of the company's lower-tier celebrities are starting to venture into short videos and live streaming. Once their traffic picks up, we'll have opportunities to get work and earn money too.

"I've also been thinking, you're not famous right now, and the company isn't providing you with good resources. Even if we need to hone our skills, we need to maintain our popularity. Short videos are developing rapidly now; we can give it a try."

“When the two-year contract expires, we won’t renew it. We can just retire to the influencer industry; that’s more secure!”

Jin Fulai and his former partners discussed this for a long time. If Xia Sang really couldn’t stay in this industry, changing careers might not be a bad thing. There are many paths to Rome!

Xiao Hong: …No wonder he’s Brother Jin; someone who’s played supporting roles for half his life is so shrewd.

“So, what do we do?” Xia Sang asked. “We’re not very familiar with this industry either.”

“Here, here, my friend’s operating manual.” Jin Fulai waved his booklet, then pulled out his phone. “First step, choose the imitation track. Here, these are some videos from male bloggers with high likes that I found for you.”

Xia Sang was deeply moved. Brother Jin not only gave him a good job but also consistently protected and supported him. He was determined to work hard and live up to Brother Jin’s expectations!

Xia Sang’s heart shattered the moment he answered Brother Jin’s call.

Upbeat music started playing as soon as the video opened. A boy was swaying to the music. Xia Sang noticed he might be without makeup and even dressed up, just like when he was an extra. Then, the music became increasingly energetic, the drumbeats becoming more intense.

In an instant—the ugly man transformed into a wild, shirtless, and handsome werewolf.

The music ended with a single "Awooo—"

It was cool, but…strangely awkward, and somehow a bit lewd.

"Brother Jin…isn't this a huge leap?" Xia Sang said timidly. He'd never done anything this revealing since his debut.

"This influencer ad is priced at 100,000," Brother Jin said.

“I think we should adapt to the changing times; sticking to the old ways will only hold us back!”

“Okay, let’s start with something simple.”

“Let’s film a simple costume change video. Your junior apprentice’s look was quite popular, wasn’t it?”

“Let’s film two videos first. One is about the junior apprentice, to attract new fans. The other is the costume change video we just filmed, to attract casual viewers.”

“Great idea! I’ll film it for Brother Xia!” Xiao Hong agreed.

The plan was unanimously approved, and everyone immediately began preparations.

A few days later, in the morning, on the rooftop of the Liang Group building.

Secretary Wang, holding his phone like it was a hot potato, walked into Mr. Liang's office. He couldn't understand how things had turned out this way while he was just asleep.

Secretary Wang stood in front of Liang Yiming's desk. Hearing his boss engrossed in documents, Secretary Wang asked, "How's Xia Sang doing?"

"Mr. Liang, she hasn't contacted us yet."

"Does she have any work lately?"

"No." Secretary Wang hesitated, taking out his phone. "But recently, Mr. Xia registered an account on the hottest short video platform and posted a video."

"Let me see it."

Secretary Wang handed over his phone.

Liang Yiming took the phone. The video showed Xia Sang replicating his previously viral junior apprentice, with tens of thousands of likes—a decent number. He swiped again, and the music was completely different from the previous, rather conventional tune.

The music was now dynamic and noisy. He saw that Xia Sang was clearly making an ugly face, striking a few poses to the music with exaggerated expressions, and then the music changed! The screen flashed—

Xia Sang wore fluffy gray wolf ears, her hair was tousled and messy, giving her an extremely youthful look. Lightly drawn black eyeliner accentuated her bright and passionate eyes, revealing a small canine tooth, her smile both roguish and adorable.

Not only that, she was also shirtless, wearing only rough black cloth on her lower body, which made her skin appear even whiter. The pink tips of her fair skin were alluring, making her both innocent and seductive.

Xia Sang, without any instruction, instinctively tried to mimic a puppy, grabbing the camera and bringing her face close. Her bright, moist eyes were as cute and pitiful as a puppy's.

The short video, only a few dozen seconds long, was watched in a flash.

Liang Yiming had 1 million likes and comments, the comment section filled with lewd remarks:

【Today I won't sleep until I lick my wife: Wife! Slurp slurp!】

【My fiery girlfriend: Beautiful! Love watching! Want more!】

【Pooping Fairy: Pink! Pink!】

[…]

With each comment he read, Liang Yiming felt his head throb even more.

He long-pressed—clicked to report, reason: pornography.

Douyin, as expected of the most popular short video platform, quickly provided feedback to Liang Yiming: "[Dear user, this work does not violate any regulations. Please watch rationally. /heart emoji]"

"Hmph." Liang Yiming chuckled.

"Master Liang, Mr. Xia is also simultaneously posting videos on other short video platforms. This platform has the best data," Secretary Wang added.

Liang Yiming looked down; the video on his phone was playing on repeat, Xia Sang transforming again in front of him.

These people are really something.
