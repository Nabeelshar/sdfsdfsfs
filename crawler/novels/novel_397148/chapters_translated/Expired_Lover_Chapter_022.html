Chapter 41 22 Dreams

Perhaps in an effort to salvage their reputation, the production team of "Intern Dad" reacted quickly, issuing a clear response on their official Weibo account immediately after the incident.

No staff members at the scene noticed any actions by participating artist Siu Lin. Due to technical issues, the original video has been transferred to the official team for processing. Please wait for the official review results; the official Weibo account will notify you as soon as possible.

The comments under the show's official Weibo account refreshed every second:

1st Floor: What grudge could they possibly hold against a child?

2nd Floor: Perhaps the target is someone else. Xia Sang is just a minor celebrity; what's there to be bothered with?

3rd Floor: A fallen phoenix is worse than a chicken.

4th Floor: Since Xiao Lin's father went to jail, his resources have gotten worse and worse, and his films have become increasingly unattractive.

5th Floor: The truth hasn't come out yet; don't act like judges, okay?! Who do you think you are?!

6th Floor: Even the official Weibo account didn't say it was Xiao Lin who released it.

...
The show's fans, other celebrities' fans, and Xiao Lin's fans started arguing, and some bystanders also joined in the comments and observation.

Some thought it might be a coincidence, but many more felt that Xiao Lin, standing there for so long, couldn't have been completely oblivious. Xiao Lin's reputation inevitably suffered, and even one of his biggest fans unfollowed him.

Marketing accounts went wild, publishing the story on various platforms overnight. Since it involved a child's life, the buzz kept rising.

Xiao Lin was suddenly universally condemned. His company had to suspend all his business, and the brands he endorsed withdrew their advertisements, with the possibility of further compensation demands.

"Brother Xia, do you really think it's Xiao Lin?" Xiao Hong asked, approaching Xia Sang with her phone.

Xia Sang has stopped all his public appearances for the past few days. Fortunately, after being tormented by Liang Ye, Xia Sang currently has no endorsements. He originally planned to arrange filming and endorsements after the variety show, but unexpectedly, this incident has turned out to be a blessing in disguise.

Adding to the recent turmoil, Xia Sang simply stopped going out, and Xiao Hong moved into Xia Sang's apartment to keep him company.

"...I don't know either, but Xiao Lin hasn't contacted me." Xia Sang checked his phone. If he really didn't do it, if Xiao Lin truly considered him a friend, would he not have even sent a message?

Xia Sang scratched his head, ignoring his inner anxiety, and started watching a TV series until he went to bed that night. In his sleep, Xia Sang dreamed of a bouquet of roses.

Grandpa Liang thought Xia Sang had sent three bouquets of roses, but there were actually four.

However, he didn't receive the fourth.

After that party, Xia Sang comforted himself for a long time, telling himself it was the best arrangement, that nothing was really wrong.

But his body's reaction couldn't lie. That day, when Grandpa Liang stroked his face, he felt disgusted.

"I really didn't break that jade carving, Grandpa Liang," Xia Sang looked at Grandpa Liang earnestly. "I was very careful when I got it; I absolutely didn't bump it."

Liang Yiming took off his coat and threw it on the sofa, loosening his tie. "This matter is in the past; there's nothing to talk about. Just be more careful next time."

Liang Yiming didn't want to talk about it anymore. Just in case, Mr. Liang always arranged for his assistant to bring two gifts when attending any banquet.

Perfection was Mr. Liang's motto.

"No, Mr. Liang," Xia Sang stubbornly tugged at Liang Yiming's sleeve, "I..."

"I've already had someone investigate the matter, and there will be results later." Liang Yiming looked at Xia Sang, "Whether it was you or not, you need to be careful next time."

"Then, Mr. Liang, do you believe me?" Xia Sang continued to ask.

Liang Yiming frowned. A broken jade carving was no big deal in Mr. Liang's eyes; the key issue was that Xia Sang acted without any method. "This isn't a question of whether I believe you or not."

Before Liang Yiming could finish speaking, Xia Sang's tears fell. She murmured, "If it were me, I would make amends. I would admit it."

Liang Yiming was shocked by Xia Sang's tears. He hadn't realized she cared so much about this.

Perhaps his expectations were too high; after all, it was Xia Sang's first time attending a gala. Liang Yiming reached out to wipe away Xia Sang's tears, but she slapped his hand away.

With a sharp "smack," the two stared at each other in astonishment.

This was the first time Xia Sang had refused Liang Yiming's touch since they started dating.

That night, Xia Sang slept in the guest room, her heart filled with agonizing torment. Master Liang had helped her so much and promised to find the truth.

His obsession stemmed from his past; he should have spoken to Master Liang properly.

This guilt reached its peak the next morning when Liang Yize and a staff member were pressed aside to apologize to him.

That day, after finishing filming outside, Xia Sang hesitated for a long time before finally buying a bouquet of roses to apologize to Master Liang.

Xia Sang returned to the villa early and saw Liang Yize's sports car parked in the garage. The living room was empty. He went up the stairs to the study; the door was ajar, clearly indicating that Master Liang had been working there when Liang Yize barged in—otherwise, he wouldn't have left the door open.

Xia Sang cautiously approached the door, hearing Liang Yize subtly coax Liang Yiming, because Liang Ye had scolded him severely that morning.

Hearing this, Xia Sang unconsciously pouted slightly.

Then she heard Liang Yize say to him, "Brother, you don't actually have feelings for that Xia Sang, do you?"

"What are you talking about?" It was Liang Ye's cold voice.

"That Xia Sang isn't really going to become my sister-in-law, is she?" Liang Yize said anxiously. "Besides being decent-looking, what does she have? Just a mistress, and maybe she's even pretending."

"What are you thinking?" Liang Yiming said angrily. "You're always fixated on my affairs."

"No, brother," Liang Yize said anxiously, "I just think Xia Sang is too petty."

"I've said before that my future partner must be able to contribute to the group's development," Liang Yiming's voice was as usual. "How could I possibly be with him?"

How could I possibly be with him?

These echoes jolted Xia Sang awake. He opened his eyes to complete darkness, momentarily unable to distinguish between the past and the present.

In a daze, Xia Sang desperately wanted to take out his phone and call Liang Yiming.

Two beeps rang out, and Xia Sang gradually came to his senses. What was he doing? Calling Grandpa Liang in the middle of the night—had he gone mad?

"What's wrong?" Grandpa Liang's voice came from the other end. Xia Sang's mind went blank, and he hurriedly said, "Grandpa Liang, are you hungry?"

"..." In the darkness, Grandpa Liang's voice sounded somewhat unreal. "You called just to say that?"

"...I dialed the wrong number." Faced with the choice between explanation and further questioning, Xia Sang chose to lie down.

Liang Yiming seemed to chuckle softly, but Xia Sang wasn't sure. "Sleep well, you're hungry. I'll bring you some food."

"Okay, Mr. Liang."

"Rest for a while, and go back to work after things calm down."

"Okay." Xia Sang wondered which "going back to work" Mr. Liang meant.

After saying that, Mr. Liang hung up.

Half an hour later, Xiao Hong was shaken awake by Xia Sang. Looking at the table piled high with late-night snacks, she asked in confusion, "This?? Brother Xia, are you hungry??"

Xia Sang nudged Xiao Hong, "Yes, yes, I'm hungry, eat up."

The next day, Jin Fulai brought breakfast to Xia Sang's apartment, only to find the two of them lying on the sofa, the table piled high with late-night snacks.

He reached out and twisted Xiao Hong's ear. "Why did you order so much late-night snacks for Xia Sang? He's an artist, an artist!"

"I didn't order them, it was Brother Xia!!" Xiao Hong jumped up and yelled.

After the morning's chaos, Brother Jin handed Xia Sang several schedules. "Take a break from work for a while. Go to class, hone your skills, don't let the newcomers beat you."

"Okay." Xia Sang had just taken the schedule when his phone rang. He looked at the screen. Xia Sang hesitated for a long time before answering.

The person on the other end was visibly agitated as soon as the call connected, "Xia Sang, I didn't put the snake in there."

Xia Sang looked down at Xiao Lin's name on the screen. The other person on the phone was still saying, "I didn't intend for you to die, no, no one died."

The rest of the sentence became frantic and contradictory, "I just wanted to scare you, Liang Yize wanted me to do this!"

"What's wrong with you?" Xia Sang sensed something was off about the other person.

Jin Ge handed her a phone; it contained a report from the production team confirming that Xiao Lin had personally witnessed a snake crawling into Xia Sang's tent.

On the phone, Xiao Lin was agitated. He retorted to Xia Sang, "Would I kill you? Would I dare?"

Xia Sang didn't answer directly. "You yourself just admitted you saw it. You almost killed someone."

"It wasn't me! I didn't do it! Xia Sang, please explain for me, okay? Please, I'll kneel down and beg you!!"

Xia Sang heard a lot of ringing on the other end of the phone. He didn't know if it was true or not, and he didn't want to guess.

"I can't help you."

"You can. Aren't you with Master Liang? Beg Master Liang! Beg him to help me with public relations."

"The production team has already issued a notice," Xia Sang said.

“So what if a notice is issued? As long as Master Liang is willing to help me, that's enough. You also turn black into white, right? I can do that too.”

“I can’t,” Xia Sang said.

Xiao Lin laughed a few times. He said, “Why are you so lucky?”

Xiao Lin’s eyes were bloodshot, his face red and swollen. He resentful, he hated.

They were both orphans, they both followed Master Liang, so why was Xia Sang safe and sound, while he had to suffer all the criticism?

He just wanted to be a star in the public eye, what was wrong with that?

But he always seemed to run into the worst people. Why was he the only one who was unlucky?

Xia Sang heard the phone fall to the ground; the call was cut off. He wondered if Xiao Lin had called out of desperation.

"Damn, this guy's a lunatic!" Jin Fulai had been listening intently. From what he'd overheard, he knew the company had probably dropped him. Xiao Lin was trying to morally blackmail others for his own actions; he wondered if Xiao Lin would face criminal charges. But, "Xia Sang, I'm telling you, don't listen to him. He's twisting the truth; you're just unlucky to run into him!"

Hearing Jin's words, Xia Sang recalled Xiao Lin's earlier comment about his good fortune.

He looked at the old callus on his palm, now removed, but some deep scars still remained.

Was he really that lucky?
