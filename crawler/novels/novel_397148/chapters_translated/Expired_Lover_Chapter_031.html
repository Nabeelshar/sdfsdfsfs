Chapter 51, Plane 31

When Xia Sang returned to the hospital, Jin Ge quickly asked her, "How is Grandpa Liang doing?"

"Grandpa Liang isn't here; he went abroad," Xia Sang replied.

“Why now of all times?” Jin Fulai broke down, a malicious glint in his eye. “Could it be intentional?”

Xia Sang shook her head. She didn’t know either, but she didn’t have the energy to speculate about things that were no longer her concern. “I broke up with Grandpa Liang, so I shouldn’t have gone to him.”

Jin Fulai looked at Xia Sang’s pale face and didn’t dare say more. “Never mind then. Even if Grandpa Liang comes, he can’t do anything. He’s not a doctor.”

“Right, he’s not a doctor.”

“Are you kidding me!”

Xia Sang smiled helplessly. “Didn’t you say that yourself, Brother Jin?”

Grandma Xia didn’t emerge from the emergency room until the afternoon, with even more tubes attached to her. The doctor, also sweating profusely, cautiously replied, "Her condition is more stable now, but... she still needs to be observed; there could be danger at any time."

"Can I go in to see her?" Xia Sang asked anxiously.

"Only one person can go," the doctor said.

"Then I'll go get you a change of clothes and some food," Jin Ge said immediately, then ran off quickly, his figure bouncing.

That night, Xia Sang fell asleep by his grandmother's bedside, but his sleep was restless. His brows were furrowed, his face showed unease, and he mumbled unconsciously incessantly.

Late at night, perhaps in a dream, Xia Sang felt someone respond to him. A pair of hands stroked his head, carrying a familiar warmth. Xia Sang seemed to sense it, his eyes slightly moist, and he murmured, "Grandma."

The voice, gentle as the wind, slowly answered Xia Sang:

"Ah, Grandma's Xia Xia."

"Xia Xia, you've had a hard time all by yourself."

"Grandma found Xia Xia in a pretty little garden. It was winter then." Early in the morning, just as dawn was breaking, Xiaxia called for her grandmother. Her grandmother found Xiaxia; her grandmother will always be Xiaxia's grandmother.

"Rest well, don't overwork yourself, and don't be too sad for Grandpa and Grandma."

"Grandpa and Grandma will always be with you. Grow up well."

"..."

"Xiaxia must grow up healthy and safe."

Those comforting words eased the worry from Xia Sang's brow, and he quickly drifted into a deep sleep.

Until, just as dawn was breaking, the hurried footsteps of medical staff woke Xia Sang. He inhaled sharply; the smell of disinfectant in the ward seemed even stronger, and inhaling it brought an indescribable pain to his lungs.

Grandma's warm voice still echoed in his ears when Xia Sang opened his eyes, only to see cold white and a continuous, sharp wheezing sound—Grandma Xia's heart had stopped beating.

The medical staff pulled up the blinds and pushed Xia Sang out. "Mr. Xia, please move aside," they said. The doctor immediately started CPR.

Xia Sang was pushed out, stunned, his eyes red. He stood there, whispering, "Please, please, anyone, save her. Please, I'll do anything."

Xia Sang kept praying, kept calling out, but the wind carried away that unseen, heavy soul.

Like a puppet on a string, Xia Sang numbly followed Brother Jin through the procedures: signing, confirming, each step feeling like walking on a knife's edge.

He stared intently as the funeral home staff tended to his grandmother's body, offered their condolences, and finally, slowly took his last step towards the crematorium, entering through the heavy iron door.

His body was taut like a fully drawn bow.

When Xia Sang watched from outside the glass as his grandmother's body entered the crematorium, the last thread of reason snapped in his mind. He pounded and pounded with all his might, the cold glass vibrating until his hands went numb, but he felt nothing. He screamed frantically, "Grandma! Grandma!"

Xia Sang's cries were like sobs of blood.

Even Jin Ge, this burly man, had red eyes, clenching his teeth and silently wiping away tears. Xiao Hong was already sobbing uncontrollably, covering her face and turning away, her makeup ruined by tears. Xingxing was startled by Xia Sang's appearance. He let go of Xiao Hong's hand and ran to Xia Sang, sobbing uncontrollably, "Brother, don't cry, don't cry, waaaaah!" He clumsily joined in the crying, just as Xia Sang had done years before when comforting his grandmother who was weeping for her grandfather.

In the first-class cabin of a plane bound for M country.

Liang Yiming put down the documents in his hand, looking at his phone on the lounge table. A strange unease stirred within him; an itching sensation lingered at his fingertips, neither rising nor falling.

The general secretary, Wang, noticed Liang's thoughts and asked, "Is something wrong, Mr. Liang?"

What is it? Liang Yiming pondered each matter. Everything had been arranged before departure; what else could have happened?

He shook his head, looking out the window at the blue sky and white clouds, the sunlight so bright it was almost blinding—it was a beautiful day.

Yet, he felt a tightness in his chest, as if he couldn't breathe.
