Chapter 47 27 Initiative

Once they were in the car, Xingxing asked curiously, "Brother Xia Sang, where are we going?"

"Xingxing will stay with you for a few days," Xia Sang said affectionately, nuzzling Xingxing's nose.

"Okay!" Xingxing pouted, his cheeks puffed out, looking incredibly cute. He was very happy; he loved Brother Xia Sang so much.

On the third day after Xia Sang brought Xingxing back to Xiao Hong's house, Jin Fulai told Xia Sang, who was sitting on the floor playing a puzzle game with Xingxing, "I heard Grandpa Liang is back."

Xia Sang was startled by Jin's words, and the puzzle toy in his hand stopped falling. Xingxing, sitting on the cushion, curiously looked up, listening to their conversation.

"Looks like he's not in very good shape, but I don't know much more," Jin Fulai said, observing Xia Sang's expression.

After Mr. Liang went to City X, the Liang Group issued an official statement on its Weibo account, stating that the matter was unverified and a rumor. They stated they were contacting local authorities for an investigation and that the Liang Group reserved the right to pursue any unverified claims. Further results would be announced at a press conference.

Upon the news broke, many marketing accounts dared not repost it due to the strength of the Liang Group's legal department. Some, out of cowardice, silently deleted or re-edited the wording, but the discussion remained significant.

These past few days, Xia Sang had tried sending messages to Mr. Liang, but each message seemed to sink without a trace.

She didn't know if he was busy or if it was intentional.

Xia Sang knew their relationship wasn't a normal romantic one, but couldn't she even receive a simple expression of concern?

Previously, when Mr. Liang said he wouldn't renew the contract, he hadn't acted so coldly.

Xia Sang felt a vague unease.

"If you want to see Mr. Liang, you can go to the villa now. I heard he went back to get some documents," Jin Fulai said, sitting on a cushion, his large belly protruding high. "My car is on the right-hand side of the elevator exit."

Xia Sang knew there was a safe in the villa's study containing a lot of confidential information.

"Where is Brother Xia Sang going?" Xingxing asked curiously. "Can I go too?"

Xia Sang smiled, patted Xingxing's head, and said, "I'll take Xingxing next time. This time, brother has to go by himself."

Driving up to the villa after so long, looking at the familiar scenery, Xia Sang couldn't help but sigh at how much time had passed.

As the villa district drew closer, the setting sun painted the sky a fiery red against the white clouds and green trees. Memories flooded back; Xia Sang recalled the same scene from the day he and Master Liang concluded their agreement.

Liang Yiming hadn't expected that the first person to visit him upon returning to the villa would be Liang Yize's father, his eldest uncle.

Seeing him arrive, Liang Yiming's resentment intensified.

"Yiming, long time no see," Liang Jinfeng smiled, his wrinkles deepening. Dressed in a white Tang suit, his hair styled in a jade bun, he exuded an air of serene contentment.

"What brings you here?" Liang Yiming asked bluntly.

"I heard the company was in trouble, so I came to see if there's anything I can help with?"

Liang Yiming scoffed. He only came now because he wanted to help? "It seems you have no say anymore," Liang Yiming said calmly.

Back when Liang Yiming successfully took over the group, he ousted Liang Jinfeng. All Liang Jinfeng had left were some shares that the Liang family patriarch had given to his two sons when they came of age, receiving a small share of dividends each year.

“Yes, but I’m still a member of the Liang family, still your uncle. How could I not care about you?” Liang Jinfeng said with a regretful expression. “Yiming, I know you’re still misunderstanding me. But your mother’s death wasn’t caused by me. You know how much your father and brother’s deaths affected her. Your mother had always had mental problems; otherwise, why would she commit suicide at home?”

“Liang Jinfeng, what are you saying!” Lin Leman, who had rushed over, shouted at him upon hearing this.

Lin Leman's fingertip almost touched Liang Jinfeng's face, yet he maintained his smile. "Miss Lin, what I said wasn't true."

Liang Jinfeng's small, aged eyes swept over Liang Yiming's hand. "I advised her to see a doctor back then, but she refused. Perhaps, if she had listened to me, none of this would have happened."

Lin Leman blushed, glaring at Liang Jinfeng. Forgetting all decorum, she grabbed her bag and threw it at him, yelling, "Trash!"

Liang Yiming remained icy. "What are you doing here? If you have nothing else to say, stay..." "Get out of here."

"I already said I came to help," Liang Jinfeng said with a smile. "And my son is in detention. I heard that after he gets out, you're going to send him to a company abroad. I just came to ask."

"With so many illegitimate children, how can you possibly ask them all?" Liang Yiming said bluntly. "Don't pretend in front of me. Nothing here concerns you."

"I also asked my son to find that brother who wouldn't help him. If you don't want to talk, there's nothing I can do." Liang Jinfeng stood up and left without a word, as if he really had only come to make a deal.

But based on Liang Yiming's understanding of this uncle, he lacked talent, but his scheming was like a honeycomb, full of holes.

He turned to his secretary, Wang, and said, "Have someone keep a close eye on him, and also see if he's involved in this new drug project."

Secretary Wang nodded in agreement, then looked up and saw Xia Sang. A flicker of surprise crossed his eyes.

"Mr. Xia, what brings you here?"
