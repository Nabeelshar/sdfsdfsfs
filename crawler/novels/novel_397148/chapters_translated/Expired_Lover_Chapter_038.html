Chapter 58, 38 Messages (Revised)

Xia Sang gripped the handle of his suitcase, the cool touch seeping into his palm. He had watched Master Liang leave here last time, and now, standing here himself, a pang of sadness gripped his heart.

“Brother Xia, you must come back! Call me when you do!” Xiao Hong tugged at Xia Sang’s sleeve, reluctant to let him go. Jin Fulai reached out to pull Xiao Hong away, “Hey, stop crying. Xia Sang is only going for a week or two, it’s not like he’s not coming back. Why are you crying like this?”

Xia Sang smiled, remaining silent. He himself had no answer as to when he would return.

As time drew closer, parting was always bittersweet, but these people could only say goodbye forever.

Xia Sang walked alone towards the waiting area, pulling his suitcase. He passed huge floor-to-ceiling windows, gazing at the blue sky and white clouds, the empty runway, and the bustling crowds outside. The enormous windows recorded his slowly moving shadow.

An announcement came on, and Xia Sang, still pulling his suitcase, carefully checked his boarding information on his ticket. He checked his ticket, queued…

Step by step, he walked towards that unfamiliar, unknown place.

The plane flew for several hours, the mottled gray-white landscape stretching out into undulating mountains, the city's skeleton stripped away, replaced by a blurry new skin.

Xia Sang stood in a county bus station in G City. He had traveled from the plane, transferred to buses, from the bustling city to the county seat, and later, to a rural town.

The concrete jungle had crumbled into scattered tiled houses; billboards faded, replaced by rough banners. The people around him dressed simply.

Xia Sang wore clothes his former housekeeper had arranged for him. Though out of season, he still looked sharper than everyone else.

He found himself somewhat out of place…

had he really changed that much?

He asked an old man squatting by the roadside smoking, “Grandpa, when does the bus to Xiajia Village arrive?”

The old man exhaled a puff of smoky smoke, his heavy rural accent almost a garbled mess, “The bus… not that fast… around four or five… then a minibus… and then you have to walk to the village entrance…”

Xia Sang struggled to pronounce the words, getting a vague answer.

He walked in the direction the other person pointed, still feeling a sense of unreality.

He was an outsider here.

But,

he could try to blend in, just like before.

Then—

he was robbed.

Xia Sang: …

Not only that, after entering the village, he encountered a torrential downpour, a rare occurrence in recent years. The signal tower on the mountain was intermittently working, and a webpage took forever to load.

Xia Sang: How could someone be so unlucky?

Xia Sang simply let Jin Ge and Xiao Hong know he was safe, turned off his phone, and stayed quiet for a few days.

Finally, three days later, light appeared in the distant sky. As soon as Xia Sang turned on his phone, he was bombarded with messages from Xiao Hong—

: Brother Xia, how are you?

Xia-ge, it's so boring without you. The company plans to have Jin-ge take on new recruits.

...
A series of Xiao Hong's ramblings followed, suddenly exclamation marks filled the phone screen:

!!

Xia-ge, are you there? Come out quickly!!!

Then came a forwarded news article:

Liang-ye is in trouble!

The internet was still intermittent today. Xia-sang saw the news headline slowly loading—

[Breaking News] Chairman of Liang Group in Car Accident, Killer is a Patient's Family Member!

The network improved, and more messages came through. Not only Xiao Hong, but Jin Ge also sent a message:

: Xia Sang, Liang Ye was in a car accident, did you see?

...
: Are you... coming back?

The screen's faint light shone on Xia Sang's taut fingertips.

The emotions she was holding back were instantly swallowed by a distant and immense clamor.

Liang Yiming opened his eyes. He turned his head to look around. He could feel a slight breeze blowing from his left, and the touch beneath him wasn't familiar.

He looked around; it was pitch black.

His body ached. He remembered being in a car accident.

He should be in the hospital now.

He slowly blinked.

But why was everything so dark? Was his eye bandaged? He touched his face; his eyes weren't bandaged, but his head was wrapped in gauze.

Was it nighttime?

But even in darkness, there would be some outline of light.

Liang Yiming called out, "Is anyone there?"

"Master Liang." At that moment, Secretary Wang's voice came from his right.

Secretary Wang was here; even at night, he wouldn't have turned off the lights. He wouldn't make such a small mistake.

Then he couldn't see.

Seeing that Master Liang had called him once and then remained silent, without immediately turning to look at him, Secretary Wang slowly turned his head, as if confirming his direction.

"Master Liang?" Secretary Wang said slowly.

“Hmm,” Liang Yiming replied. He paused for a few seconds before speaking again, “Call the doctor, I think there might be something wrong with my eyes…”

Before Liang Yiming could finish speaking, someone walked in from outside the door.
