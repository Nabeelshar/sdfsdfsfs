Chapter 73, Section 48: Sleeping (Supplement)

Xia Sang waited outside the door for quite a while before hearing Liang Ye's voice.

"Come in."

When Xia Sang entered, Liang Ye was already standing in the steamy air, wearing a black bathrobe, his hair wet, his eyes closed. He walked in, took Liang Yiming's hand, and slowly led him to the bathroom door.

This feeling was novel to Xia Sang.

Her hand touched Liang Ye's soft hair; the warm air from the hairdryer passed through her palm.

Liang Ye sat upright on the edge of the bed.

So well-behaved.

Xia Sang smiled secretly.

"What are you laughing at?" Liang Yiming suddenly spoke, startling Xia Sang.

“No.” Xia Sang withdrew her hand. “My hair’s dry, Mr. Liang. Is there anything else I can help you with?”

“No.”

Xia Sang climbed off the bed, put away the hairdryer, and stood in front of Liang Yiming. “Mr. Liang, I’ll go rest now. I’m next door. Just call me if you need anything.”

As she spoke, Xia Sang handed the pager that Butler Liu had given her to Mr. Liang.

Looking up, she saw Liang Yiming holding the pager. Perhaps because he was blind, he looked somewhat dazed, his head slightly lowered. The warm, yellow light from the wall lamp cast a shadow on Liang Yiming’s face, making him appear somewhat pitiful.

Xia Sang was startled. What’s wrong with me? That’s Mr. Liang! Xia Sang patted herself on the back. Honestly, seeing that Master Liang was willing to come to the countryside, she started having delusions.

"Goodnight, Master Liang."

"Mm."

Back in her room, Xia Sang received a message from Xiao Hong. Xiao Hong had a filming project in City B and hadn't come back with her.

After replying to Xiao Hong's message, Brother Jin called again.

"Brother Jin, still up so late?" Xia Sang teased.

"What time is it!" Jin Fulai had just come from a drinking party, his voice hoarse and breathless.

Xia Sang looked out the window. It was pitch black, with only the low chirping of insects and the faint glow of a few streetlights along the path. There were no shows in the village; every household had to turn off their lights and rest early.

"How's it going on your end?" Jin Fulai stood by the roadside, sobering up. Cars came and went, horns blared incessantly, and colorful lights illuminated the bustling city. "Did Grandpa Liang cause you any trouble?"

"No." Xia Sang thought about how Grandpa Liang had acted earlier; he'd been quite obedient.

"Xia Sang, you've taken him back now," Jin Fulai said in a low voice. "What are your thoughts? Do you still want to stay with Grandpa Liang... or..."

With Grandpa Liang? Xia Sang pursed his lips, took a deep breath, and slowly said, "No..."

He and Grandpa Liang had broken up; why would he still be thinking about being Grandpa Liang's contractual partner?

Right now, he only considered Grandpa Liang a friend.

Even though he still harbored some romantic thoughts tonight, it was simply because he wasn't used to it yet. After all, even if he didn't want to, his body was still very familiar with Master Liang.

He just needed to learn how to treat Master Liang as a friend, forgetting all the things they had done in the past.

"Master Liang is my friend now."

While Xia Sang was talking to Jin Fulai, Liang Yiming in the next room remained in the same position after Xia Sang left. After a while, he slowly groped his way to lie down on the bed.

Although the sheets had been changed to the silk ones from the villa, he could still feel the difference, even the smell of the air was different.

Outside the window, there were the chirping of insects and the rustling of leaves, all in a completely unfamiliar environment. Liang Yiming couldn't sleep even more. Qin Lang wasn't in the room, and he hadn't been given any sleeping pills.

He lay in bed, tossing and turning.

He usually spent nights like this alone.

But…

Liang Yiming touched his pager. Xia Sang was next door.

After Robles poisoned him, the only warmth he could draw from Robles was gone.

He wanted to go next door to find Xia Sang.

This thought churned incessantly in his mind, until Liang Yiming felt he was becoming obsessed, constantly muttering about Xia Sang.

Could it be that he really had feelings for Xia Sang…?

Otherwise, why did he come here? He was truly insane…

Liang Yiming sat up, stood up, but found it difficult to move. He couldn't see.

With each step, he didn't know what he would encounter.

Liang Yiming leaned against the wall, muttering numbers to himself, his feet pacing around the room.

The next day, Xia Sang opened her eyes, thinking of Grandpa Liang. His pager hadn't rung all night; she wondered how he was doing.

Xia Sang quickly got up to go see Grandpa Liang.

As soon as she entered, she found Liang Yiming had changed out of his pajamas and was already dressed, sitting on the edge of the bed. "Good morning, Grandpa Liang."

Did Grandpa Liang change himself? That's amazing.

Xia Sang couldn't help but sigh; some people are just naturally stubborn, stubborn their whole lives. "Master Liang, you're up so early? I've already contacted Butler Liu; they'll be here to bring you breakfast soon."

Xia Sang smiled, approaching him, and noticed the weariness beneath Master Liang's slightly lowered eyes, dark circles under them, and his complexion was rather poor.

Master Liang hadn't slept well.

Xia Sang opened her mouth, wanting to show concern for Master Liang, but for some reason, she didn't say a word.

She silently helped Liang Yiming wash up and then took him to the living room for breakfast.

Breakfast was brought by Qin Lang, who smiled and handed Xia Sang the plate full of food.

"Good morning, Xia Sang. This is breakfast Huang Ma made for you."

"Thank you."

"You're welcome."

Qin Lang suddenly asked, "Did Grandpa Liang sleep well last night?"

Xia Sang looked at Qin Lang. "Not really, Dr. Qin... Is this normal?"

Xia Sang felt a little nervous. He was the one who brought Grandpa Liang here, and he didn't know if he had done the right thing.

"It's normal. Grandpa Liang has had very poor sleep all year. He can't fall asleep normally."

Can't fall asleep normally?

"What's wrong?"

"He's afraid of the dark." Qin Lang covered his mouth with his hand, afraid he would laugh out loud.

Xia Sang looked at Qin Lang in confusion. Wasn't Grandpa Liang blind? Afraid of the dark? And Grandpa Liang had never had this problem before.

“Dr. Qin, you’re joking with me. Grandpa Liang isn’t afraid of the dark.”

“That’s because the darkness of night has an end, but blindness doesn’t.” Qin Lang leaned closer. “Spending your whole life in the dark is not the same as sleeping. Haven’t you heard of a dark room? People can go crazy if they stay in it for too long.”

Xia Sang’s heart skipped a beat. She secretly closed her eyes for a moment, worried about really losing her sight.

At that moment, Xia Sang realized how naive she had been, how simple her thinking had been.

“What about before?” Xia Sang frowned, anxiously asking.

“Didn’t he keep Radish? It was to comfort him. But Radish is still in the hospital.” Qin Lang raised an eyebrow. “But besides animals, people can too…”

For example, Mr. Xia could keep Liang Yiming company. Qin Lang hinted.

Xia Sang thought about it seriously for a moment, then answered Qin Lang affirmatively, "I understand."

"Okay, then you understand. I'll be going now." With that, Qin Lang ran out of Xia Sang's yard.
