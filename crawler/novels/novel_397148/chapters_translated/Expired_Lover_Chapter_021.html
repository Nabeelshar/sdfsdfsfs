Chapter 40 21 Dog Owners

"What do you suggest we do?" Jin Fulai's heart, which had just softened at Xia Sang's tears, hardened again when he received the notification to take Xia Sang to see Master Liang. "You caused this mess, take responsibility for it."

Xia Sang was also filled with anxiety.

Upon entering the elevator, they encountered Bai Tinglin again. He looked at him; Bai Tinglin hesitated, but finally called out to Xia Sang, "Come here for a moment."

Jin looked at Xia Sang. "Do you know him?"

Xia Sang shook her head, but still followed Jin and Bai Tinglin to the emergency exit. There was no one around. Bai Tinglin seemed to have unloaded a heavy burden. He carefully examined Xia Sang, but couldn't see anything special about her. He wondered why Master Liang had chosen her.

But it was none of his business anymore. Being kicked out like that by Master Liang last time was too humiliating, and seeing Liang Yize and Xiao Lin's reactions afterward, he gave up on finding a sugar daddy.

He wanted to be famous, but it seemed his pride and mental fortitude weren't strong enough.

He'd been working diligently for the past two months, and although his career hadn't taken off, he'd managed to secure some business.

The only thing bothering him was Xia Sang.

She'd tricked him in front of Liang Yize last time, and then he saw her on the same variety show with Xiao Lin, acting like good friends.

"Do you guys know that Xiao Lin is Little Liang's man?" Bai Tinglin asked, arms crossed, looking at their bewildered expressions.

This was kind of compensation for tricking them last time.

“Not only that, my agent used to handle Xiao Lin too, and said he was also with Master Liang.”

This was something my agent let slip when he was drunk one time. Apparently, Xiao Lin was his first client when he started working there, and somehow he ended up in Master Liang's bed, so they replaced him. He was very indignant about it.

“That’s all I wanted to say. Don’t tell anyone I told you. Even if you bring it up, I won’t admit it.” Without waiting for Xia Sang and the others to react, he turned and left.

Jin Fulai took a long time to react. “Wh…what??”

Xiao Lin was Liang Yize’s lover, and formerly Master Liang’s lover!

My God, what a messed up relationship!

Does Xiao Lin have that much charm?

Jin Fulai couldn't resist gossiping with Xia Sang about Xiao Lin, but noticed Xia Sang's unpleasant expression.

Yes, not long ago, Xia Sang had praised Xiao Lin to him, saying how good he was in this way and that, but it turned out he was just putting on an act.

Jin Fulai couldn't help but think back to the first season, when Xiao Lin was doing well in the competition with his little guest, but tripped and fell with Xingxing. It was hard not to connect the two.

Jin Fulai scratched his head, inwardly cursing, "Should I go to a temple and pray? This feels like such bad luck."

"Xia Sang..." Before Jin Fulai could finish his words of comfort, his phone rang again. Secretary Wang urged them to go upstairs.

"Let's go up first," he said, pulling Xia Sang along quickly.

Xia Sang's mind was still a mess. He suddenly felt everything was so chaotic. When he saw Master Liang, he couldn't say a word. He glanced at Master Liang and then dared not look again.

Did Master Liang know that Xiao Lin was on the show with him? Did Master Liang look at Xiao Lin the same way he looked at him?

One was in the past, the other was in the present. Perhaps one day he would become the past too.

Xia Sang felt as if his life had fallen into a false world.

His relationship with Master Liang was fake.

His relationship with Xiao Lin was fake.

Liang Yiming looked at the absent-minded Xia Sang, his brows furrowing. He hadn't expected Xia Sang to be daydreaming at a time like this.

His tone turned cold as he said, "You'll stay in the apartment for now. The company will handle your affairs. Don't go out until things calm down."

Jin Fulai nodded, indicating he would follow the company's instructions.

Xia Sang remained silent.

Jin Fulai understood that Xia Sang hadn't recovered. Who could accept their friend suddenly becoming a "colleague," especially one who was probably a scheming, manipulative woman?

Liang Yiming called out to him, "Xia Sang, did you hear what I said?"

Xia Sang opened his mouth, then nodded.

Xia Sang didn't remember how he vaguely returned to the apartment. The last thing he remembered was Liang Yiming frowning at him, cold, tall, and distant.

When Xia Sang and Jin Fu returned to the apartment, Liang's Star Entertainment Company's official Weibo account had already posted an apology. First, they apologized for the incident, then listed the compensation they would provide to Xingxing and the orphanage, and announced that Xingxing was out of danger and that they would continue to monitor her treatment.

Finally, they explained why Xia Sang knew the password to Liang's villa: Liang's beloved dog, "Robbs," adored Xia Sang, so Liang had hired her to play with him.

They also attached a video posted by an anonymous netizen, which was filmed after the first season of the children's variety show ended.

Netizen comments:

1st Floor: Is the celebrity Xia Sang just there to take care of the dog?

2nd Floor: Does anyone actually believe such a ridiculous reason?

3rd Floor: It's not necessarily about having dogs; you get to know each other just by living together. /laughing emoji

Netizens were all mocking this dog-owning incident, clearly saying it wouldn't work. But then, when Liang's Star Entertainment Company released Xia Sang's part-time dog-owning salary, netizens were in an uproar.

Netizen Comments:

1st Floor: ? ? What? Taking a cut? You said taking a cut!

2nd Floor: Honestly, I don't believe it. You fire him, and I'll try it myself.

3rd Floor: Dogs are better than people... Spending tens of thousands to play with them.

4th Floor: I still think it's outrageous... It's too fake.

The official Weibo account posted several videos: one of Robles suffering from separation anxiety and feeling depressed, and another of Xia Sang playing with Robles, lively and energetic. Not only that, but a large number of wealthy cat and dog lovers flocked in, shouting, "What's wrong with spending money to play with your son/daughter, as long as they're happy!"

Then they started showing off the "big things" they did for their pets, like gold-plated diamond dog tags, designer bags for their dogs, pink princess rooms for their cats, and three servants—truly living like princesses.

This shocked many netizens outside the pet community.

#WhyCan'tThereBeOneMoreRichPeopleInThisWorld#

The netizens' frenzy shifted the focus of the issue. In the past few days, netizens have been making fun of it online, and numerous other interesting stories have emerged on the forum. The "Intern Dad" phenomenon quickly faded from the spotlight.

It seems the matter has reached a satisfactory conclusion.

But Xiao Lin paced back and forth in the house, biting his fingers. He hadn't had a gig in almost two months, and he couldn't just sit around waiting to die. He was waiting for someone.

Whatever it took, as long as it kept this bubble looking beautiful and dreamlike, he was willing to do it.

Before Xiao Lin could take his next step, the apartment doorbell rang. He hurriedly opened the door, and standing there was Liang Yize.

Liang Yize entered and scanned Xiao Lin from head to toe. Compared to two months ago, Xiao Lin looked noticeably more haggard, his tired eyes fixed on his thin face, completely devoid of life. "What brings you here?" he asked.

Upon seeing Liang Yize, Xiao Lin's eyes reddened, and he leaned forward, pressing tightly against Liang Yize. "Yize, you have to help me."

"Help..." "I'm being considerate by only putting you on hiatus for a short time." Liang Yize shoved Xiao Lin aside. "Look at the state you're in now."

"I did it all for you!"

"What's it to me? My brother already scolded me, so don't you dare say another word."

Just then, Liang Yize's phone rang. He didn't want to answer, but the caller seemed incredibly urgent.

"What is it?" As Liang Yize's phone call dragged on, his face grew increasingly dark. He turned to Xiao Lin, who was cowering beside him, and grabbed his collar. "You released the snake?"

"Wh...what?" Xiao Lin shook his head frantically. "I didn't, how could I do such a thing?"

"No, it's all over the internet now!" Liang Yize opened a link sent by his subordinate and threw the phone at Xiao Lin.

The whole story of Xingxing being bitten had almost been buried under countless messages during this period.

This morning at 9 AM, someone posted a video titled, "Was Xingxing's snake bite an accident?"

The video shows a man in a white shirt and brown casual pants slowly approaching Xia Sang's tent. Because the video was a zoomed-in cut from a live stream, aside from the blurry figure and clothing, almost nothing is discernible.

The blogger, filled with righteous indignation and using the variety show tag, posted numerous in-depth posts.

Finally, a curious passerby clicked on the post, igniting the first spark.

Meanwhile, opening the girl's profile page revealed a screen full of screenshots of Xingxing, cheers, and diary entries; she was clearly a devoted fan of Xingxing,

and deeply emotionally invested in her idol.

After the incident involving Xingxing, seeing the hype gradually subside, I became anxious and started meticulously reviewing screen recordings from every angle online. Not only that, I used various tools to zoom in and compare, finally finding the video shared above from Fei Hong's perspective.

Her video caption reads:

During the live stream, instead of addressing personal issues, why did this artist leave without permission?

Why did they go to Xia Sang's tent? If they were just passing by, why did they stay for more than 5 minutes?

Finally, why did they check their own tent before entering, even mentioning the possibility of snakes? I ask artist @蕭林 why?

The second post continued—

Although Xingxing is just an ordinary person, ordinary people also have human rights.

The third post…

The fourth post…

The posts were full of illogical points. Some variety show fans noticed them first, and after comparing them, they began to question them:

1st floor: It's really a bit incomprehensible.

2nd floor: To say it's a coincidence is too much of a coincidence, isn't it?

3rd floor: That makes sense. It's ridiculous that she's been watching for days.

4th floor: Poor Xingxing, ordinary people have no rights. We demand the show's production team investigate thoroughly!

The storm quickly blew up the comments on Xingxing's official Weibo account and the "Dear Dad" section of the show. People are enjoying the drama and are now digging up Xiao Lin's past controversies.

Therefore, subordinates who knew about Liang Yize's relationship with Xiao Lin hurriedly called Liang Yize, as this matter might affect Liang Yize and his salary.

Meanwhile, Liang Yize was already furious with Xiao Lin.

Finally, his brother's attitude towards him had improved, and now Xiao Lin was causing him trouble again, and he had no idea about it!

"What are you looking at for so long?" Liang Yize asked. "Did you do it or not?"

"Fine," Liang Yize said, his tone turning hostile. "I don't care what you do, I didn't assign you to do this. And you know what you should and shouldn't say."

"What do you mean..." Xiao Lin.

“We have absolutely no connection. I didn’t get involved in this at all.”

Liang Yize saw Xiao Lin cross his arms and chuckle, making Liang Yize feel a little uneasy. He asked, puzzled, “What are you doing?”

“Is Young Master Liang going to apologize to your brother again?” Xiao Lin straightened up. “Sure, but you have to give me ten million.”

Liang Yize looked annoyed. “I’ve given you plenty of resources before.”

“Tell me, what if Master Liang knew someone was going to call him ‘brother’ while having sex with him?”

“Are you crazy?!” Liang Yize’s eyes instantly reddened.

“Yeah, I’ve gone mad.” Xiao Lin shoved Liang Yize away. “None of you are any good. Haven’t I been obedient enough to you? I do whatever you want, and then you try to get rid of me the moment something happens.”

Xiao Lin chuckled. Not so easy.

“Damn it, you think I won’t kill you?” Liang Yize clenched his fists.

“If I die, I’ll say I did it, or that you told me to.” Lin Xiao raised his eyelids contemptuously. “You told me to check his chat history, and I have plenty.”

“Yes, but I didn’t tell you to kill him!” Liang Yize shouted, becoming increasingly agitated. He knew that if Xia Sang and that child died, he would be a murderer.

Damn it.

“Yeah, but who knows if you’ve said anything to me behind my back?” Xiao Lin chuckled, glaring fiercely at Liang Yize. “Why did you have to pull all those stunts? If you’re so rich, you should have just killed him from the start. Why all this fuss? You’re useless.”

Liang Yize finally couldn’t hold back and punched Xiao Lin in the face. “You’re a complete lunatic!”
