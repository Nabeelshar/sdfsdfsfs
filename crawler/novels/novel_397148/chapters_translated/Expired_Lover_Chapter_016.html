Chapter 35 16 Secrets (Revised)

In an office in a high-rise building, the air was filled with the faint scent of bergamot. Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting a soft, silky glow on the off-white walls. The room was quiet, with only the gentle hum of an aromatherapy diffuser and a light mist; everything was peaceful and serene.

Two men sat on two comfortable beige sofas, one in a suit, the other casually dressed but impeccably.

“I was feeling better before, so why has it relapsed recently?” Liang Yiming asked coldly.

The person opposite him said helplessly, "Master Liang, you're a little better, not cured. Even if you were cured, your psychological issues could still resurface."

"Then what use are you?"

Qin Lang rubbed his forehead. "Liang Yiming, saying such hurtful things really hurts your therapist's feelings."

"Hmph."

"Master Liang," Qin Lang leaned forward slightly, "you have to accept it."

"If you resist internally, that wound will only keep oozing pus."

"Even if I clean it for you from the outside again and again, the rotten flesh inside needs to heal from the inside out."

"That requires you to do it yourself."

Qin Lang tried to communicate with Liang Yiming.

Liang Yiming lowered his eyes, his tall, straight figure, a black suit encasing his strong, powerful legs, like someone from a poster.

But the scarred hands resting on his thighs, clinging to his skin, clashed sharply with Liang Yiming's refined appearance.

"Then you're useless."

"No, I can still... help you clean your wounds, can't I?" Qin Lang clearly sensed Liang Yiming's worsening mood. Looking at the gloves Liang Yiming had removed from the table, he changed the subject.

"And your little boy, if you're no longer averse to his touch and it doesn't arouse excessive desire, you can have more contact."

"With your hand." Qin Lang lightly tapped Liang Yiming's hand from a distance.

Liang Yiming looked at his hand, the woman's scream echoing in his ears again.

He loathed it, yet couldn't let go.

After leaving Qin Lang's place, Liang Yiming was still flustered when his secretary informed him, "Master Liang, we just received news that Mr. Liang's father and Miss Lin have returned to City B."

Liang Yiming's expression shifted between anger and uncertainty upon hearing this.

That night, Liang Yiming returned to his old mansion in the city.

As soon as he entered, a servant took his coat, and the mansion's butler indicated, "Master Liang, Miss Lin is waiting for you in the living room."

Liang Yiming didn't respond, his heavy footsteps making soft sounds on the wooden floor.

He saw a middle-aged woman sitting alone in the spacious living room, her dark brown sofa making her face appear even paler.

She looked at the woman, a woman in her forties, with her elegantly styled hair in a neat updo, high cheekbones, thin red lips, and a slender, tall figure with sharp, defined features—a beautiful silhouette almost like a paper cutout.

“Auntie.”

The woman smiled warmly at Liang Yiming, her coldness instantly softening. “Yiming’s back.”

“How have you been lately? Why did you suddenly come back?”

“I’ve finished up with things outside, so I came back to see you.” Miss Lin was Liang’s mother’s younger sister, and in recent years she had been helping Liang’s company develop and manage its overseas businesses, usually residing overseas. The reason she was called Miss Lin was because Lin Leman, although over forty, was still unmarried.

"And your uncle, who received his share of the profits, failed in his business ventures outside. I heard he wants to come back to the group, so I came along to see him."

Grandpa Liang's father's family passed away early, leaving only his uncle. Unfortunately, this uncle was ambitious but incompetent. He and Grandpa Liang's mother often clashed in their early years, eventually leading to Grandpa Liang's mother's suicide. Grandpa Liang then divided the group and kicked everyone out.

"I heard you took that little starlet back," Lin Leman asked curiously.

"Yes."

"You've been raising her since she was nineteen, aren't you tired of her?" Lin Leman was even more surprised. She herself hadn't married, but she'd had quite a few boyfriends and lovers.

“I’m used to it.”

“I told you, these things don’t last. The longer you keep them, the more complicated you become.” Lin Leman looked at her red fingernails. Her last lover was initially very considerate, but later he got too greedy, and the ending wasn’t very pleasant. “Too greedy.”

“I know.” The housekeeper came to indicate that dinner was ready, and Liang Yiming invited Lin Leman to the dining room.

The two ate quietly for a while. Lin Leman chewed slowly, then slowly asked, “It’s Sunday today. Did you see your therapist?”

“Yes,” Liang Yiming replied.

Lin Leman looked at the black gloves on Liang Yiming's hands, a sigh escaping her lips. She didn't approve of what her sister had done to Liang Yiming, even dying in front of him when he was only a teenager. But after all, she was her sister, Liang Yiming's mother.

Lin Leman tried to comfort Liang Yiming. "Don't blame your mother. She didn't mean it. What happened to your father and brother was a huge blow to her. She was always pampered like a little girl in our family..."

Liang Yiming's knife and fork scraped across the porcelain plate, the sound mingling with the shrill scream of a woman echoing in his mind, "If it weren't for you, why would I be going through all this? Take that disgusting thing off your hands!"

At that moment, Liang's mother's fingernail scratched a mark on his arm.

In that instant, a sharp pain shot through his arm, followed by an itch deep within his bones; the pain and itching intertwined, creating a nauseating sensation.

He looked coldly at the woman before him who bore a striking resemblance to his mother, and beckoned to the housekeeper and maid, "Auntie, you rest here. I have to go."

With that, he stood up and strode away, leaving Lin Leman feeling helpless and somewhat lost.

Today is the last day of the first episode of "Internship, Dad."

Because the celebrities had spent all their budget, at the production team's request, everyone had to set up a stall to earn money.

After some discussion, the simplest activity for the stall was decided to be singing and dancing. First, each celebrity would sing a solo, then the children would sing a children's song together, and finally, there would be a group sing-along to give the show a perfect ending.

The moment they appeared, the adorable children and star power instantly attracted a large crowd in the city square.

Le Mingzhi, acting as the host, said, "Thank you everyone for coming. We're filming a variety show, and we've set up a stall here. We hope you'll continue to support us."

He then placed his hat in front of him and began with a cool dance performance.

Many young girls recognized them and immediately screamed, prompting the production crew's security personnel to quickly maintain order.

The sound of cell phone cameras clicking away filled the air.

The performance order was determined by drawing lots, and luckily, Xia Sang wasn't last, but she ended up in the most awkward position.

Of the group, Huo Ran and Xiao Lin had both participated in talent shows, Huo Ran's group was an idol group, and Xiao Lin had sung OSTs, so their singing skills were quite good. Xia Sang had only performed a few commercial concerts, and although he had taken vocal lessons at the company, he was far inferior to the others.

Xia Sang's position was right between Huo Ran and Xiao Lin.

Holding the signed slip, Xia Sang realized Liang Yize was seizing every opportunity to embarrass him.

He shouldn't have taken this variety show; he should have stayed in theaters, playing supporting roles and bit parts—it wouldn't have caused so much trouble.

Liang Yize generally didn't participate in film and television work.

Liang was practically handing himself over to be humiliated; Xiao Hong's analysis was complete nonsense.

Xia Sang sighed helplessly.

After his dance, Le Mingzhi rapped. Le Mingzhi seemed thoughtful, yet his stage style was wild; Huo Ran, on the other hand, looked cool and aloof, but his voice was surprisingly deep and tender.

Xia Sang, without realizing it, was also listening, actively cheering for everyone, even lifting up Xingxing to show him how thick the crowd was. Several children were having a great time, some twisting and turning, others shyly clinging to their older brother's legs—the atmosphere was just perfect.

Comments:

1st Floor: Ahhh, I wish I could be there!!

2nd Floor: I'm always surprised by the contrast between these two guys.

3rd Floor: Hahaha, Xingxing is so cute!

After Huo Ran finished singing, Xia Sang took the microphone. "Hello everyone, I'm Xia Sang. My singing isn't as good as the others, but please clap just as hard!" She smiled, and everyone around her laughed.

Xia Sang sighed. He had changed; he was no longer the little boy who had followed Master Liang.

He had been too intimidated to speak by the crowd and the faces of others.

"Today I'm bringing you an old song. I hope you like it!"

As she finished speaking, a lively, vintage-style background melody played, followed by Xia Sang's voice, which drew another round of laughter.

The lyrics, originally sweet and cute for a girl, coming from Xia Sang's mouth were a stark contrast, yet still somewhat endearing. Moreover, the old song was widely known and had a simple melody, so many people sang along.

Comments:

1st Floor: Xia Sang always makes me laugh so hard, this must be my grandma's song!

2nd Floor: I can't stand Xia Sang's constant attempts at humor, she has absolutely no professional skills.

3rd Floor: Her singing is just average.

4th Floor: You can't compare them like that, she's not a professional.

After Xia Sang finished singing, many people applauded, and the atmosphere didn't become awkward.

Xia Sang felt relieved. Everyone thought he was just joking, unaware that this song was actually Xia Sang's most familiar song.

Because this was Xia's grandma's favorite song. She liked to sing while doing chores, even though she didn't sing well, and her voice was a little hoarse from age, singing such a sweet song could easily make her the target of ridicule.

But despite the hardships of life, Xia's grandma always tried her best to bring sweetness to herself and Xia Sang.

...

Finally, during the grand finale, everyone sang the variety show's theme song together, a song they had practiced the night before.

Holding hands, under the blue sky and white clouds, they sang.

Even though everyone's hearts weren't aligned, the live stream still captured a beautiful moment.

—The first episode of "Internship Dad, My Dear" has successfully concluded!

At 5 PM, everyone officially said goodbye to the live stream and announced that the next live stream would be in 5 days, and the edited version of the first episode would be released in 3 days. They hoped for everyone's continued support.

After several days of live streams and promotion, the reach of the "Internship Dad" variety show has increased significantly, and the number of viewers leaving comments and saying they would continue watching the next episode is several times higher than when it first aired.

The director excitedly called "cut." All the footage had been shot; the investment and returns for this variety show were quite good. Several maternal and infant product and food brands had already contacted and were in talks. If the ratings could be maintained for the next episode, it had a chance to become a mini-hit.

As soon as everyone left the camera's view, they descended with an air of exhilaration, complaining, "It's too tiring. I'll never participate in a children's variety show again."

Huo Ran said goodbye to Le Mingzhi and got into the van.

Xiao Lin specially said goodbye to Xia Sang and made a promise to hang out together next time, which moved Xia Sang to tears.

The other children's parents all picked up their children, while Xingxing was held by Xia Sang, who was preparing to take him back to the orphanage later.

Xia Sang and Xingxing sat at the villa entrance waiting for Jin Ge's car.

Jin Ge had taken the wrong route using navigation and was stuck in rush hour traffic. "Okay, Jin Ge, take your time, safety first."

"Damn it, I shouldn't have trusted the navigation shortcut."

"Hahaha." Xia Sang hadn't finished laughing when she received a message from General Manager Wang—[Mr. Xia, we need you at the villa tonight.]

Xia Sang was about to reply with an "Okay."

Suddenly, a golden blob came rushing from afar, faster and faster, until it pounced on Xia Sang in a final leap.

Robbs wagged its tail incessantly at Xia Sang, barking and circling her.

Xia Sang broke out in a cold sweat upon seeing this. He looked around; the production crew had mostly left, but a few scattered staff members were still cleaning up. A few people glanced in their direction before turning away, seemingly uninterested.

It was then that Xia Sang remembered this was Robles's break time that afternoon.

Nothing had happened in this villa area for the past few days, so he had let his guard down.

He hadn't expected this to happen so soon after the live broadcast ended.

"Robbles, be quiet," Xia Sang whispered.

Xingxing looked at Robles curiously. "Brother, is his name Radish?"

Xia Sang, seeing the others some distance away, whispered, "Yes, Xingxing, help your brother, don't call it by its name. Let's find the puppy's owner."

"Okay," Xingxing said happily.

He quickly pulled Xingxing and Robles to find the maid. Sure enough, they saw a woman standing outside the villa, anxiously peering in. Presumably, seeing the crew members, she knew it wasn't appropriate to come in.

Xia Sang quickly pulled over a staff member and handed Robles back to her, so she could return him to the maid.

Robles refused to leave, and was only pulled off his leash by Xia Sang and the maid, turning back every few steps.

But unnoticed, someone secretly took out their phone and filmed the scene, then uploaded it online.

[Wow, they captured a celebrity interacting with a dog in a villa area, so cute!]

Because the blogger was unknown, the post didn't receive much attention.

No one knew what kind of explosion this video would cause when it was unearthed in the second episode of the show.
