Chapter 52, 32 Signatures

"What do you mean by this?" Jin Fulai stood in the company conference room, his anger turning into a mocking laugh. He slammed his hand on the table. "Damn it, you've been rushing us here like we're being hounded, only to have a newbie like you terminate our contracts! And what's this compensation?"

After handling Grandma Xia's funeral, the company phones hadn't stopped ringing. Today, only a junior employee came, and when asked anything, he knew nothing. Jin Fulai was so angry he felt a lump in his throat, utterly frustrated.

He looked down at Xia Sang, her face haggard, sitting there blankly as if she hadn't quite recovered, and straightened his back even more.

“This is utterly insulting!” Brother Jin slammed his pen on the ground. “We won’t sign! Go tell your boss we won’t sign!”

Xia Sang slightly raised her head and tugged at Jin Fulai’s sleeve. She knew Brother Jin was furious, but harassing a young girl wouldn’t help.

The girl’s face was pale with fright. She looked towards the door, her voice soft and stammering, “I…I don’t know either. I was just following President Lin’s instructions…”

“President Lin? Which President Lin?” Jin Fulai didn’t react immediately. Xia Sang subconsciously frowned. President Lin?

Tap, tap, tap.

Clear, rhythmic footsteps approached from afar, each step weighing on Jin Fulai and Xia Sang’s nerves.

The meeting room door opened again.

Miss Lin appeared at the meeting room door with her assistant and HR manager. She was dressed in a black cheongsam, her makeup impeccable, her thin red lips like blades, slowly sweeping over Jin Fulai and Xia Sang with a hint of barely perceptible mockery.

The girl beside her quickly followed the leader to the side. Lin Leman walked straight to the head seat and sat down. Her voice was icy, "We notified you of the contract termination several days in advance. We've already compensated you for the damage to the company's reputation caused by Xia Sang's scandal this year; that's already being lenient."

She paused deliberately, looking at the haggard-looking Xia Sang, "The company has no obligation to continue cleaning up the messes of people whose reputations are already ruined."

Jin Fulai seemed to have been provoked, "What did you say? Was that our problem?!"

Scandal?

If it weren't for that young General Manager Liang and Xiao Lin causing trouble, none of this would have happened!

Jin Fulai was about to retort when Lin Leman interrupted him, her voice suddenly turning cold, "Whether it's your problem or not is up to Entertainment, and the fans and audience. Yiming is soft-hearted and severed ties with you, but he's keeping you around. I think someone with no value doesn't need to be kept. Appearing in front of the audience every day only brings up these scandals."

As long as Xia Sang appears online, people will bring up Liang Yize and Xiao Lin's scandal.

The suspicions of Liang Ye and Xia Sang being kept will also continue.

In Lin Leman's view, cutting the root of the problem by letting Xia Sang leave the company directly is the right thing to do.

Xia Sang clenched his fists tightly. From a company perspective, he was indeed useless, but…

Just then, his phone rang, breaking the tense atmosphere. Everyone's eyes were on Xia Sang.

Xia Sang took out his phone. It vibrated incessantly. The name on the screen was etched in his memory—the person he had most wanted to see these past few days: Liang Yiming.

Jin Fulai, sitting next to him, also saw the screen and looked at Xia Sang anxiously, his lips moving as if he wanted to say something.

Lin Leman remained seated, the sarcastic smile deepening, as if waiting for Xia Sang to pull some trick.

Xia Sang stared at his phone screen.

Those few seconds felt like an eternity.

Xia Sang pressed the button, placed the phone face down on the table, and didn't look at it again.

Time seemed to freeze. He took a deep breath; the air felt like a knife cutting into his body, but strangely, it brought him to his senses. He looked at Lin Leman, his eyes devoid of anger or pleading, only a settled understanding. He slowly spoke, "I can sign, but what happened before wasn't my responsibility; in fact, I was implicated. I don't accept that condition."

Lin Leman raised an eyebrow at Xia Sang. "Then what do you want?"

"Give me the compensation I'm entitled to."

"No, at least an extra hundred thousand or two," Jin Fulai quickly added.

Lin Leman scoffed. Without further ado, she instructed her assistant to revise the contract. To her, "normal compensation is already charity." If she wanted to make things difficult for Xia Sang and the others, she wouldn't negotiate like this. The revised contract was quickly delivered to Xia Sang.

Jin Ge and Xia Sang reviewed it clause by clause until the final signature page.

The black ink on the white paper was cold and piercing.

Xia Sang picked up the pen and glanced at Lin Leman again. He had seen Lin Leman a few times at the villa. He nervously tried to find the right words, greeting her, but she acted as if she hadn't seen him, brushing past him completely, utterly ignoring him.

Xia Sang's hand trembled slightly, yet every word, every stroke of his pen was clear and distinct.

After signing, he would have nothing more to do with this place.

He was going to start anew, alone.

The crimson ink stains clung to Xia Sang's fingertips, as if drawing blood from a cut. Her breathing quickened slightly as she carefully and firmly pressed her fingerprint onto the signature area.

A wave of overwhelming exhaustion washed over her, but at the same time, a sense of peace welled up within her.

The other party immediately stamped the document and handed Xia Sang the termination agreement.

Xia Sang thanked them, said nothing more, and stood up to leave with Brother Jin. As she reached the door, she said, "Miss Lin, goodbye." The other party still didn't reply, but it no longer mattered to Xia Sang.

It was all over.
