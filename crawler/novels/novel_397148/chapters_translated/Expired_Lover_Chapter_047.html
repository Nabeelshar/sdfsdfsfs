Chapter 71, 46 Coffee

Xia Sang sat in a coffee shop in the city. Someone had arranged to meet him at 10 o'clock, but Xia Sang arrived more than half an hour early.

He looked at a post on his phone titled "Suggestions for Psychological Adjustment in Case of Sudden Blindness," trying to calm himself.

Since returning from Grandpa Liang's place yesterday, he had been feeling unsettled, constantly searching online for information on psychological trauma stress, physical trauma stress response, psychological trauma from accidents, and even depression, its early symptoms…

After searching all night, he came to a conclusion—

He needed to see a qualified doctor at a hospital when he was sick, otherwise his life would be in danger.

Based on what's said online, Grandpa Liang might have psychological problems including, but not limited to, depression, bipolar disorder, and affective disorders, possibly even eye cancer, a terminal illness…

Xiao Hong glanced at Xia Sang's phone and almost burst out laughing, “Brother Xia, how many lives do you have? Daring to self-diagnose online, hahaha, give me two!”

Xia Sang smiled helplessly, “I just feel like Grandpa Liang is acting a little strange.”

Although Grandpa Liang is usually very certain of his thoughts, he wouldn't get angry over something so unclear.

Something's wrong, that's what Xia Sang thought.

“Didn't Brother Jin say Grandpa Liang is seeing a psychologist?” Xiao Hong said.

Xiao Hong's words jolted Xia Sang awake. He quickly found Jin Fulai, "Brother Jin, what's the name of that psychologist you mentioned last time? Do you have his contact information?"

"What's wrong?"

"I want to know about Grandpa Liang's situation."

"..." Jin Fulai paused, his expression complex. "Are you sure? You're going to get involved in Grandpa Liang's affairs?"

Xia Sang looked at Jin Fulai and nodded.

He couldn't possibly ignore Grandpa Liang.

Jin Fulai sighed and scrolled through his contacts. "His name is Qin Lang. Let me see his contact information."

As he searched, Jin Fulai was about to say something.

But then, Xia Sang suddenly said, "No need."

Jin Fulai looked at Xia Sang in confusion.

Xia Sang held up his phone. "He added me." The phone screen displayed a friend request from Shen Xin, with the note:

[Mr. Xia] "I'm Qin Lang, Liang Yiming's psychologist. Let's meet!" /wink.emoji

"Mr. Xia, hello."

At ten o'clock, Qin Lang arrived on time.

He wore gold-rimmed glasses, a white shirt, and black trousers, looking refined and cultured, with a polite smile, but an undeniable sharpness.

Xia Sang hadn't expected Qin Lang to look even more refined than in his online promotional photos. He quickly stood up, somewhat awkwardly.

Xia Sang himself wasn't highly educated, but the other man seemed like a highly educated individual. He always held this type of person in higher regard.

"No need to be polite, please have a seat," Xia Sang said, watching Qin Lang sit down with a polite smile, waving his hand and ordering an Americano, looking every bit the elite.

“I’m Mr. Liang’s psychologist. I apologize for bothering you today, but I’m here to talk to you about Mr. Liang.”

Xia Sang gripped her phone tightly and asked, “Mr. Qin, what do you want to ask me?”

“I wanted to ask what you and Mr. Liang talked about yesterday?”

Xia Sang shook her head. “They didn’t say much, just a few words, and Mr. Liang got angry.”

After saying that, Xia Sang continued, “Mr. Qin, can you tell me what’s wrong with Mr. Liang?”

Qin Lang also shook his head. “We can’t disclose patients’ medical records.”

Xia Sang looked at him with some confusion. What did he want to see him about?

“But I can tell you about some of his condition,” Qin Lang said. “I also want to ask you for some help.”

“Help?” Xia Sang wondered. What could he possibly do to help?

Qin Lang, sensing Xia Sang's confusion, smiled and swirled the stirring spoon in his cup. "It's been so long, and for Secretary Wang to contact you, your relationship with Master Liang must be quite good; he's someone you can trust."

Xia Sang was observing Qin Lang, and Qin Lang was returning her gaze. Xia Sang was handsome, not the currently popular pretty boy type, but rather quite traditionally Chinese, with a clean-cut hairstyle and bright, piercing eyes, like a refreshing green lemon on a summer's day, pleasing to the eye.

"Mr. Xia, how old are you this year?"

Xia Sang was slightly taken aback. What kind of question was that?

"22."

"How many years have you been with Master Liang?"

"Two years."

So young. She was with Master Liang at 19? Like a pet bird. Qin Lang smiled.

"So, Mr. Xia, what are your thoughts on Mr. Liang?"

"Wh...what thoughts?" Xia Sang was taken aback by Qin Lang's question. What did he mean?

"Mr. Liang's problem is a psychological one. He's been controlling it, but the eye problem has affected him, and it's causing him distress."

Xia Sang understood; Mr. Liang was a very proud man.

"You know his family has a lot going on." Qin Lang looked up at Xia Sang. He knew how Xia Sang had left and terminated her contract. "Now, if he can leave this environment and travel, it would be a good thing for him."

Qin Lang smiled at Xia Sang.

If you don't want to stay, you can take him with you.

Xia Sang paused upon hearing this.

Yesterday, seeing Mr. Liang like this, Xia Sang was conflicted, but she never imagined that Mr. Liang would leave with her.

Who is he to make Master Liang go with him? What gives Master Liang the right to go with him?

“Think about it carefully,” Qin Lang said. “You’ve seen Master Liang’s condition; it’s not good. If he continues to stay like this, it’s bound to get worse; it’s just a matter of time.”

Xia Sang’s heart sank.

“So, if you could take him away, as a friend, or someone repaying a debt of gratitude, save him, what do you think?”

Xia Sang vaguely understood Qin Lang’s meaning, and her heart raced.

This is too audacious.

In Xia Sang’s mind, Master Liang was someone high and mighty; he was going to take him away.

But… thinking of Liang Ye's condition, Xia Sang didn't immediately refuse. "Let me think about it."

After Xia Sang left, Qin Lang pushed away his Americano, ordered a sweet cappuccino, and, looking at the perfect sunlight outside, nodded with a smile while listening to the music.

Young people are so easy to fool.

Villa, gym.

Under the coach's guidance, Liang Yiming completed a set of simple resistance training exercises, his forehead soaked with sweat.

Since losing his sight, Liang Yiming has had even fewer opportunities to move around; he must maintain his body's most basic functions.

Liang Yiming persisted with his previous fitness habits.

However, now, for many of his workouts, he needed someone to guide him, or rather, something Liang Yiming didn't want to talk about—care. “Where’s Qin Lang?” Liang Yiming wiped his sweat and asked the butler, Liu, standing beside him.

Qin Lang also enjoyed working out, and Liang Yiming usually joined him at the gym.

“Mr. Qin went out early this morning,” Butler Liu replied. “Should I contact him?”

Liang Yiming frowned. He had hired Qin Lang outright, and now he was leaving without even a word. “No need. Just deduct it from his performance review.”

“Okay.” Butler Liu couldn’t help but chuckle, already imagining Qin Lang’s outburst upon his return. Then, he brought up another matter, “The old man just called you. Should you call him back now?”

The old man Butler Liu referred to was Liang Yiming’s grandfather.

After handing over the business to Liang Yiming, his grandparents, due to poor health, went abroad and settled overseas.

Later, after Liang Jinfeng's downfall, he kicked them out of the country and they lived with him.

Liang Yiming answered the phone, "Grandpa."

"Yiming, how have you been lately?" A frail, aged voice came from the other end.

When Liang Yiming was in the car accident, the two elderly people wanted to come back, but their poor health prevented them from taking care of him and made travel unsuitable, so they ultimately didn't return.

They exchanged a few routine words of concern.

The conversation inevitably turned to someone. Grandpa Liang spoke slowly, his voice earnest, "Yiming, I've heard about your affair. Your uncle really went too far this time."

"Hmm."

"He just wanted to prove himself." Grandpa Liang sighed, "Alas, it's also my fault."

Liang Yiming gave a sarcastic smile. This phone call, while ostensibly about Liang Jinfeng's fault, clearly aimed to protect him.

As the old man grew older, with fewer and fewer people around him, he naturally became more tolerant.

“Your eyes aren’t better yet. I’ll talk to him and tell him to stop his underhanded tactics. Let him assist you; give him some face.”

Liang Yiming chuckled. “Grandpa, I’m the one who got ousted by the board. You must have the wrong number.”

“…” Old Master Liang was momentarily speechless. He knew his grandson; Liang Yiming wasn’t one to give up easily.

His grandson was thoughtful and capable, but unfortunately, he wasn’t close to them.

When he was little, Liang Yiming’s mother insisted on raising him herself. As he grew older, because Liang Jinfeng’s influence was subtly implicated in his mother’s death, their relationship became even more strained.

“Yiming, I don’t know what you think, I just want you both to be well. You two are blood relatives after all,” Old Master Liang could only say. “I’ll also talk to Afeng. His uncle shouldn’t have acted this way; it was his fault this time.”

Liang Yiming found it all laughable.

The phone call had just ended when another call came in.

The voiceover on the phone told Liang Yiming it was Lin Leman.

Lin Leman’s voice was clear and bright. She had moved her business to China this past year, lived in the old house, and was doing quite well, but her relationship with Liang Yiming seemed to have deteriorated.

But she still had to make this call today.

"Yiming, are you feeling better today? Miss Luo's birthday is in a couple of days, are you free? Miss Luo, you know..."

Liang Yiming gripped his phone tightly, knowing full well he disliked showing up.

He felt an itch and aches all over his body, a yearning to burst forth from within. He wondered if his act of feigning failure had been too successful lately, making him seem easy to talk to.

These people were all going crazy in front of him.

Lin Leman couldn't hear Liang Yiming's words, her heart pounding. Liang Yiming had already moved out of the old house and stopped going to the company.

“You just need to show your face, and you can go to the lounge,” Lin Leman added. “Don’t worry. No one will bother you.”

“What are you thinking?”

“You’ve been taken down by Liang Jinfeng. You need to find someone to help you. Miss Luo’s father said he’ll help you if you marry his daughter! Do you understand? Right now, only I’m helping you!” Lin Leman was very excited. She couldn’t let that scoundrel Liang Jinfeng win. “Besides, it’s been a year. I’ve seen several specialists treat you for a year with no improvement. You need someone to take care of you, right? I think Miss Luo looks very well-behaved and gentle, really…”

Liang Yiming hung up immediately.

His expression was ambiguous.

Now everyone wanted to arrange things for him.

Two days later, early morning.

Qin Lang pushed open the door and saw a stack of cigarette butts in the ashtray on Liang Yiming's desk. He waved his hand, thinking, "This guy's practically pickled."

"Butler Liu told me to take you downstairs for breakfast." Qin Lang slumped onto the sofa as soon as he entered, his phoenix eyes darting around, observing Liang Yiming's expression. "Didn't sleep well again last night? Try to smoke less, or you'll die young."

Liang Yiming didn't reply, and Qin Lang didn't mind. He stood up and pushed his wheelchair in front of Liang Yiming.

"How about I help you walk a bit?" Qin Lang watched as Liang Yiming adjusted the wheelchair until it was perfectly upright before standing up and sitting down.

His legs aren't lame; why use a wheelchair?

Qin Lang didn't say it aloud; he knew why Liang Yiming insisted on using a wheelchair.

Qin Lang pushed Liang Yiming out of the room and, as they took the villa's elevator downstairs, offered him a few words of comfort, his mind preoccupied with something else.

Liang Yiming hadn't slept well all night and had a headache. He hadn't noticed it before, but now he found Qin Lang increasingly noisy.

"Stop talking, my head hurts."

"Fine, sir." Qin Lang tossed Liang Yiming to the butler and ate his breakfast. "If the next one gets upset, they'll dock my performance bonus again."

As they ate, a servant came in to announce, "Master Liang, Mr. Xia is visiting."

Qin Lang smiled, his face downcast. He's here. He's here.

Xia Sang entered and saw Liang Yiming and Qin Lang having breakfast. A little embarrassed, she said, "Sorry to bother you."

"What are you doing here?" Liang Yiming had already put down his utensils.

"I'm going back to G City tomorrow, and I wanted to say goodbye to you... again, Master Liang."

Qin Lang and Butler Liu stared at each other, glancing between Liang Yiming and Xia Sang.

Anyway, Master Liang is blind now.

Xia Sang blushed.

He had come alone today.

"To the study," Liang Yiming said.

"Hey, what are you two talking about?" Qin Lang raised his voice. "What secrets can't you tell us?"

"Qin Lang, if you say another word, you're out," Liang Yiming said coldly.

"Yes, yes, boss." Qin Lang stuffed the bacon and egg into his mouth.

Pretending to be something he's not.

Keep being arrogant, I'll raise the price soon!

In the study.

"Master Liang, I'm going back to G City." Xia Sang watched the maid push Master Liang to the desk. Seeing this familiar scene, Xia Sang felt a little nervous.

He had forgotten how many assignments he had helped Master Liang with here.

Some forgotten memories returned to his mind.

Xia Sang glanced at Liang Yiming. He didn't know when they would see each other again.

"You came here just to tell me this?"

Xia Sang hesitated.

"Master Liang, the scenery in G City is beautiful."

"Hmm." Liang Yiming.

"The village is very quiet... Master Liang, would you like to go out for a walk? I..." Xia Sang took a deep breath, "If you'd like, would you like me to go to G City with you..."

How ridiculous! He was supposed to be going to G City, but Xia Sang was accompanying him.

After these words, the study fell into an even longer silence.

Xia Sang, what are you thinking about now? What do you want to gain?

Liang Yiming remembered Xia Sang's tears that day.

How much pity, how much sincerity, was in those tears?


Xia Sang left.




Qin Lang watched Xia Sang walk away dejectedly, then quickly followed Liang Yiming. "She's leaving, aren't you going to stop her?"

"Stop her for what?"

"Stop her, of course. You like her, but if it really doesn't work out, you can go with her."

Liang Yiming laughed. These people have gone mad. Well, if that's the case, then let's make this mess even more chaotic.
