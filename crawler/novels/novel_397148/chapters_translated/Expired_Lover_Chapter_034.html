Chapter 54 34 Dinner

Across the ocean, Liang Yiming's hotel was located in the best spot by the harbor.

The meeting was about to end when Liang Yiming abruptly interrupted him with a decisive gesture. The overseas branch manager, who was still speaking, fell silent in surprise.

"No need for pleasantries. Revise according to the client's requirements. I need the revised version by 2 PM tomorrow," Liang Yiming's voice was icy. "Overtime pay double."

Those below nodded in agreement. Liang Yiming got up and left the meeting room, returning to his hotel room.

He leaned back, his broad body sinking into the soft, comfortable sofa. He rubbed his aching temples; the continuous high-intensity work and jet lag had left his nerves taut like a string.

But what truly fueled his pent-up, unvented frustration was Xia Sang.

What exactly did he want?

For the first time, Liang Yiming seriously considered his own feelings for Xia Sang.

And what did he really want?

Liang Yiming closed his eyes, appearing quiet as if asleep, while Secretary Wang, who had been following behind, tried to minimize his presence.

Until Liang Yiming spoke, "Check the flights back to China for the next few days and book seats for me." He opened his eyes, sharp and brows furrowed. "Upon landing, immediately convene a meeting of all senior executives of Morning Star Entertainment. No one is allowed to be absent! Miss Lin must also attend."

Secretary Wang's heart skipped a beat, and he immediately replied, "Yes, Mr. Liang, I'll arrange it right away." He thought to himself, "So, he's going to make an example of those people as soon as he gets back to China, and Miss Lin too…" While Secretary Wang was still lost in thought, he heard Mr. Liang tell him to go back and rest.

"Okay, Mr. Liang." Secretary Wang left the room, closing the door behind him. He saw Mr. Liang walk to the floor-to-ceiling window, overlooking the dazzling foreign night view below.

The lavish lights outside the window flickered, casting a long, long shadow of Mr. Liang.

The following afternoon, during a break in the meeting, Secretary Wang sat with Liang Yiming in a private lounge. He calculated that, based on the meeting's schedule, it would take another two days before he could return home.

He needed to finalize the airfare arrangements with the airlines for those few days.

He saw Mr. Liang light a cigarette, chain-smoking, the butts piling up.

The burning, persistent unease emanating from Mr. Liang grew stronger, almost overflowing.

It made one's heart burn with anxiety as well.

Jin Fulai heard Xia Sang hang up the phone, and a lump formed in his throat. He touched his face, thinking, "Damn it, what's going on?"

“Brother Jin, don’t be sad.” Xia Sang looked up at the endless stream of cars in front of them. “Let’s not cry. If you cry during dinner, Xiao Hong will cry too, and his wailing will sound awful.”

“Am I sad? I’m just regretting that Liang Ye’s hundred thousand or so,” Jin Fulai retorted stubbornly. “His dog has a 100-square-meter doghouse; I’m not even as well-off as it.”

Xia Sang found it amusing. He hadn’t seen Radish Si in a long time, and he didn’t know if he would ever have the chance again.

When Xia Sang and Jin Fulai returned to Xiao Hong’s house, the spacious living room was already filled with the overwhelming aroma of hot pot. The mandarin duck hot pot on the table was bubbling away, steam rising from under the air conditioner.

Xiao Hong and Xing Xing were preparing hot pot ingredients in the kitchen: sliced beef, tripe, meatballs, and chilled cola.

"You're back. Sit down."

The group sat around the table. The pot was hot, but the air was heavy. Xing Xing, holding chopsticks, looked at the adults.

After a while, Xiao Hong's muffled voice broke the silence, "...Xia-ge, are you really leaving?"

"Yes," Xia Sang replied. Perhaps to ease the tension, Xia Sang stood up and scooped two pieces of shrimp paste for Jin-ge, a large meatball for Xiao Hong, and a small meatball for Xing Xing. These were their favorites.

Xia Sang's expression was obscured by the steamy fog. She slowly said, "I... I'm done here. I want to take Grandpa and Grandma back to their hometown."

"Sigh," Xiao Hong sighed, angrily stuffing her mouth full of meatballs. "Why don't you talk to Grandpa Liang and fire me too? My son's career is ruined, my brothers' career is over, what's so fun about the entertainment industry? If we fire them now, we can make N+1."

"Just eat! Stop talking so much." Jin Fulai slapped Xiao Hong on the back of the head.

"Ouch!" Xiao Hong protested, "Brother Jin, I told you I quit, so you can't pat my head!"

Xia Sang forced a smile, seemingly trying to force back his usual carefree grin, but the events of the past few days had drained him of all energy. He had no strength left, and in the end, it only amounted to a slight curve at the corners of his mouth.

He reached into his pocket, fumbled around, and pulled out two cards, handing one to Brother Jin and the other to Xiao Hong. These two cards had been prepared beforehand.

He said slowly, "I'm leaving. I don't know if I'll affect you at the company... I don't have much to give you, just this little money as a safety net."

Thinking of this, Xia Sang regained some strength and smiled, "If you're unhappy, you can fire the boss anytime, I'll do anything."

Upon hearing this, Xiao Hong's eyes immediately welled up with tears. She instinctively wiped them away; how could she cry at a time like this?

She found she couldn't wipe it all away, and cried out in a hoarse voice, "Brother Xia, don't do this, I can't take it... Waaah..."

Jin Fulai, standing nearby, also quietly reddened. He gritted his teeth and slapped Xiao Hong hard on the back. "Why are you crying? Xia Sang wants to do her own thing and walk her own path. It's not like we'll never see each other again, stop whining."

"Brother Jin, you're a bad person." Xiao Hong's crying continued, and Xingxing was also on the verge of tears. Xia Sang quickly picked Xingxing up. "Xingxing, don't cry, Brother Xiao Hong is just too emotional."

"Where is Brother Xia Sang going? I'll go too." Xingxing hugged Xia Sang tightly.

“What are you doing? You're all causing trouble.” Jin Fulai said helplessly. “And you, what can we do with you?”

“I can sing for Brother Xia Sang!” Xingxing shouted. “I can even help Brother Xia Sang eat his vegetables!”

“…Your Brother Xia Sang isn’t a picky eater.”

“Xingxing, you can help me eat next time.” Xiao Hong, her eyes red, came closer and said.

“Hao Hong, get away from me…” Brother Jin.

“Ahhh, don’t call me by my full name!!”

“…”

“…”

Xia Sang watched the group bickering and making a ruckus, his eyes unconsciously narrowing, a smile playing on his lips, his heart filled with warmth.

He always seemed to meet such wonderful people.

After dinner, everyone had drunk some wine. Xiao Hong got drunk after one glass, and Xingxing was coaxed to sleep.

Only Jin Fulai and Xia Sang remained to clean up the mess. Jin Fulai had downed several bottles of wine, his face flushed, but he still seemed sober. He emptied the trash from the table and slowly asked, "So, when are you leaving?"

Xia Sang took the dishes into the kitchen and came out to say, "In the next couple of days."

"What? So soon?!" Jin Fulai blurted out in surprise.

"...There's nothing left here," Xia Sang said, head bowed, "I want to send Grandma and Grandpa's ashes back as soon as possible."
