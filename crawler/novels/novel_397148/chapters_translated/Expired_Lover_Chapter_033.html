Chapter 53 33 Anger (Bonus Chapter) Supplement + Revision

It was nighttime in Country A when they disembarked. Secretary Wang immediately turned on his phone to contact their partner company, who had arranged transportation to the hotel.

But as soon as he turned on his phone, the screen lit up faintly. Secretary Wang quickly glanced at it, his face immediately tightening. He hurriedly stepped to Grandpa Liang's side and said, "Grandpa Liang, we just received news from back home. Grandma Xia... she passed away the day before yesterday afternoon."

"Passed away?" Liang Yiming's steps froze on the spot, as if struck a heavy blow to his chest. His first thought was of Xia Sang's broken-down sobs, just like that time.

Under the cold airport lights at night, his handsome profile resembled a cold plaster cast, his voice equally icy. "What's going on?"

"His organs had been failing for a while, and this sudden attack... his body couldn't take it," Secretary Wang explained. "And Butler Liu also sent me a message saying Mr. Xia visited the villa, and he informed him about you clearing it out."

Secretary Wang watched as Mr. Liang's face grew increasingly stiff and cold. He wondered if Mr. Liang was even aware of how terrible his expression looked.

Sometimes he couldn't understand Mr. Liang's thoughts. In his view, Mr. Liang cared about Xia Sang. Perhaps he didn't think so himself, but he had been more devoted to Xia Sang than any of his previous lovers, and for a longer period.

"Mr. Xia also called me," Secretary Wang added.

Liang Yiming had seen the call when he turned on his phone, but he wanted to wait. He hesitated.

He wasn't sure what Xia Sang wanted to see him about.

What if Xia Sang changed her mind? How should he react?

But unexpectedly, it turned out that Xia Sang's grandmother had passed away.

Liang Yiming had flown overnight, and coupled with his recent sleep deprivation, this sudden outburst left him feeling like his head was about to explode.

His phone rang again; it was his partner from Country A, negotiating a new drug, calling.

The ringing was like a deadly sickle.

*
Liang Yiming sat in his car, his fingertips repeatedly tracing the cold car window as he dialed the number himself, breaking his earlier promise.

But time and again, no one answered.

The dazzling foreign nightscape outside the car window rushed past, finally settling into a blurry gray-white.

*
Liang Yiming attended a small meeting immediately after landing. He should have been resting, but domestic affairs had kept him delayed for too long.

During the meeting, Liang Yiming felt uneasy, something that had never happened before. His mind unconsciously drifted to Xia Sang.

He felt a strange sense of guilt.

In an instant, he couldn't understand why he felt guilty.

He and Xia Sang had broken up.

He had given Xia Sang double what he owed her.

...

Midway through the meeting, General Secretary Wang subtly passed a message to Liang Yiming on his phone. It was from Xiao Zhang, who was in China on orders to find Xia Sang:

—Boss, Mr. Xia is currently terminating his artist contract with Morning Star! Should we stop him, or what should we do?!

Liang Yiming's face darkened instantly upon seeing this message. He told General Secretary Wang, "Pause immediately."

No sooner had he spoken than Xiao Zhang sent another message:

—Boss, I've already contacted the branch office HR, but the contract has already been signed /sad.emoji.

At that moment, Liang Yiming felt a burning heat with every breath he took.

In an instant, he knew who it was.

Even though Xia Sang had severed ties with him, no one would target Xia Sang.

Similarly, even in exceptional circumstances, or if Xia Sang herself requested contract termination, the shrewd people at the entertainment company would definitely consult with General Manager Wang for confirmation.

Unless someone with more power and influence made the decision.

For example—

His aunt, Lin Leman.

In the parking lot of Morning Star Company, Jin Fulai's car slowly started, the engine churning.

Jin Fulai hesitated, realizing that further questions were pointless at this point. Finally, he sighed heavily and asked, "What are your plans next?"

Xia Sang fastened her seatbelt, turned to Jin Fulai, and forced a smile. "I'm planning to leave B City and take Grandma back to our hometown." Xia Sang smiled broadly. "Grandma keeps saying she wants to go home."

As she spoke, he looked up and saw Jin Fulai's chubby face, looking worried, pressed against him. The scene before her was quite comical. "You're not running away from the law, you'll be back, right?"

Xia Sang laughed and cried at the same time. "I haven't even left yet... but Brother Jin, you should really lose some weight, be healthier."

Jin Fulai forced a smile. "Your brother Jin is blessed with good fortune."

On the way, Xia Sang's phone rang again, vibrating wildly until it was slightly warm. The screen displayed the words "Secretary Wang."

Xia Sang answered.

"Mr. Xia, I couldn't get through to you earlier. That termination contract wasn't arranged by Master Liang, you didn't sign it, did you? Of course, it's okay if you did sign it. If you're willing, you can continue to stay with the company with the highest possible terms." As soon as the call connected, Secretary Wang spoke rapidly.

Xia Sang spoke calmly, "Thank you, but no need."

"Mr. Xia, would you like to reconsider?" General Secretary Wang hurriedly explained, "We've just landed in Country A, and this arrangement was made unilaterally by the branch office without our consent."

Before Xia Sang could speak, General Secretary Wang quickly added, "Mr. Xia, you can reconsider; there's no need to rush your reply." General Secretary Wang's tone carried a hint of... With an apologetic tone, it was painful for anyone to suffer such a loss after the death of a loved one. "We are truly sorry that you have to go through this at such a time, and we will offer appropriate compensation."

"No need, General Secretary Wang," Xia Sang sighed, speaking slowly, "Actually, the company has already paid the full compensation, and I have accepted it. I have thought it through."

A brief, suffocating silence fell on the other end of the phone.

In the car, Jin Fulai's eyes kept glancing at Xia Sang, but Xia Sang's head was turned to the window, and he couldn't see her face. She was just holding on by herself.

On the other end, General Secretary Wang wanted to persuade her to stay, but didn't know what to say. He glanced at Mr. Liang, who was sitting beside him listening to his call.

Just as Secretary Wang was about to speak, a hand suddenly reached out…

A deep, suppressed voice: Xia Sang, are you sure?

It was Liang Yiming.

Xia Sang's knuckles gripping the phone tightened abruptly, his fingertips turning ashen, his breath catching in his throat almost imperceptibly.

At that moment, Xia Sang remained silent, and Liang Yiming said nothing more; it was a silent tug-of-war.

Xia Sang slowly closed his eyes. He thought of the villa that had been cleared away. Since he was someone Liang Ye could erase from his life, it was better for everyone to separate sooner rather than later.

He also needed to learn to start a new life.

When he opened his eyes again, he answered clearly, "Yes, Mr. Liang."

After speaking, Xia Sang paused, then said softly, "And Mr. Liang, thank you, thank you so much for your previous care, but I really don't want to stay at Morning Star anymore. I'm tired."

Secretary Wang felt a tightness in his chest for some reason.

He heard Mr. Liang say—

"Okay."

Looking down, he saw Mr. Liang's face visibly darken, the veins on his strong arms bulging like twisted vines, his knuckles gripping the phone so tightly he almost crushed it.

...How did things turn out like this?
