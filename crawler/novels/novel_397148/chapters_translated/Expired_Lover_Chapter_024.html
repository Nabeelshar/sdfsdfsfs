Chapter 43 24 Trending Topics

Xiao Lin is dead.

Xia Sang couldn't believe it. The person who called him yesterday was gone today.

"What happened?"

"Brother Xia, look." Xiao Hong handed Xia Sang her phone, opening the homepage's trending topics. Several entries appeared in succession:

"Xiao Lin, First Central Hospital, failed resuscitation"

"Xiao Lin committed suicide"

...
Xia Sang read through them and roughly understood what had happened.

Small paparazzi had been staking out Siu Lam's house for weeks without success, and were about to give up when they saw ambulances and police cars rushing in early this morning. Siu Lam was carried off on a stretcher, his clothes and bedsheets stained with blood.

Several paparazzi, vying for headlines, released their stories in quick succession.

Siu Lam was effectively blacklisted by his company, with neither his manager nor the company reacting immediately.

Many passersby at the scene and at the hospital filmed the incident and broadcast it online in real time. Siu Lam was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment, but ultimately died despite resuscitation efforts.

Many passersby who followed the entire incident speculated that Xiao Lin might have made the emergency call himself.

He probably tried to save himself, but it was too late.

Xia Sang gripped his phone tightly, unable to understand what could have driven Xiao Lin to such a desperate act.

Isn't living more important than anything else?

"Brother Xia, are you alright?" Xiao Hong noticed Xia Sang's agitated state and, remembering that Xiao Lin was Xia Sang's friend and had called him yesterday, worried about any negative associations and wanted to offer comfort.

Jin Fulai, carrying breakfast, pushed open the door, shouting, "Oh no! Oh no!... Hey... you're all awake! Hurry up and get dressed, come with me to the company for a meeting."

This was destined to be an eventful morning. All the executives of Morning Star, Xiao Lin's manager, and anyone who had contact with Xiao Lin were summoned back to the company for a meeting.

When Xia Sang and the others arrived, a large group of people were crammed into the office. Liang Yiming was sitting at the head of the meeting room.

Xia Sang also saw Bai Tinglin as she entered. He was sitting next to Xiao Lin's manager, Bai Tinglin, who was also an artist under Xiao Lin's management, though not famous.

Bai Tinglin also saw Xia Sang enter, his heart filled with even more mixed emotions. Damn it, I never expected Xiao Lin to commit suicide. What kind of mess is this? His manager next to him looked even darker, filled with anger. Xiao Lin's death had really put him in a difficult position. What were he going to do now?

In the meeting room, everyone was lost in thought; some felt regret, some annoyance, some hatred…

At nine o'clock, everyone was present, and the meeting officially began. Reports were given on the public relations plan, Xiao Lin's personal situation, and his movements after his business was suspended. During this brief exchange, Xiao Lin's agent mentioned, "Xiao Lin's phone is missing, and all the account passwords and verification information on Shenbo's various platforms have been changed."

Upon hearing this, everyone's heart sank. This meant they couldn't log into Xiao Lin's account anymore. Was Xiao Lin, who wanted to die, going so far as to change his own account password before he did? This was too strange; there was no guarantee Xiao Lin had a backup plan.

For a moment, everyone was at a loss. The man was dead; where were they supposed to find him?

"Isn't this very dangerous? Could the PR team contact Shenbo and other platforms to ban his account?" someone suggested.

"Banning him now would be like admitting guilt, saying we coerced Xiao Lin," another person interrupted.

"Then what's your opinion...?"

Amidst the commotion, Xia Sang saw Liang Yiming move. He raised his hand, drawing everyone's attention. Xia Sang heard him say, "After the incident, who was responsible for handling Xiao Lin's case, and what was the proposed solution?"

Everyone looked at each other, and finally, Xiao Lin's manager stood up. "I was responsible."

"What were his previous moves? How did things escalate like this?"

Xiao Lin's manager was sweating profusely. What was he supposed to say? Besides the company's punishment, Liang Yize had also instructed him to do many disgusting things to torment Xiao Lin.

Seeing the other person's stammering manner, Liang Yiming slammed the documents on the table. "Did Liang Yize arrange anything else for you?"

Xiao Lin's agent, terrified, could only tell him everything.

Liang Yiming's face darkened as he listened. This man not only blacklisted the other person, but also made Xiao Lin drink with him, go out for social events, and torment him.

This was truly outrageous.

He made a phone call and immediately shouted, "Liang Yize, you come up here right now!"

Within minutes, Liang Yize entered the meeting room. He walked to Liang Yiming's side, and Liang Yiming stood up, raised his hand, and slapped him across the face in front of everyone.

"Slap—" The loud slap echoed, and the scene instantly fell silent.

“Liang Yize, do you know what you’ve done wrong?”

Liang Yize’s cheeks flushed red as he stared at his brother in disbelief.

“You’re transferring Chenxing tomorrow,” Liang Yiming announced.

“Brother, I was just teasing him a little, I didn’t really do anything to him,” Liang Yize pleaded, disregarding his pride.

Liang Yiming didn’t even glance at Liang Yize. Liang Yize had crossed Liang Ye’s line; he hated people who said one thing and did another.

“Brother, listen to me.”

“Liang Ye, look at your phone.” The general secretary, Wang, suddenly reached in; the page showed Xiao Lin’s blog post, which had just been shared over a thousand times in just one minute.

The next second, tens of thousands of times.

Siao Lin said his life is a tragedy. He just wanted to be a small-time celebrity, but that's impossible.

He was an abandoned baby. When he was very young, he was adopted by the famous director Huang, who initially thought it was the beginning of happiness.

Who knew that his adoptive father, Director Huang, who seemed kind and approachable, was actually a devil.

Siao Lin also posted many photos, including one where a tiny Xiao Lin is held in Director Huang's arms. Both are looking at the camera; Director Huang is smiling broadly, while little Xiao Lin is stiff, looking like he's about to cry. Director Huang has one arm around his waist and the other touching his face.

It looks extremely bizarre, but this is just the most ordinary photo among them; some photos directly and blatantly reveal Director Huang's perverse fetishes.

Xiao Lin, in his doctoral studies, openly stated that he not only had relationships with Director Huang in his childhood, but also with some current or retired executives, directors, and producers.

He suffered and struggled.

He wanted to save himself, so he secretly collected evidence and, through other victims, got Director Huang and his agent imprisoned for illegal economic activities related to opaque contracts.

But he didn't expect his agent to be released so quickly and to know that he was involved in the whole affair.

He had already disposed of all the documents from his adoptive father's company; it turned out that the agent, who had remained silent, had even more hidden backups, some of which he himself was unaware of.

At that moment, Xiao Lin broke down. Hiding in his room, staring at his terrifying eyes and swollen cheeks in the mirror, he roughly knew his fate—either now or in the future.

And today was the end.

Finally, perhaps out of revenge, he mentioned Liang Yize, saying he too had been kept by Liang Yize, that Liang Yize was a scumbag who forced him to do all sorts of disgusting things, even forcing him to go out for social events after being blacklisted.

Being chased by debt collectors, being coerced, and facing an uncertain future finally crushed him.

As soon as this news broke,

the Liang family was once again in the eye of the storm. Netizens turned their attention to people Xiao Lin had mentioned: a certain executive, a certain producer, a certain veteran actor, and finally, Morning Star Entertainment, Liang Yize, Liang Yiming, and Xia Sang. Because of this incident, Xia Sang's past was brought up again by netizens.

1st Floor: I've really had enough of this gossip today; I'm practically living on Morning Star's official Weibo account now.

2nd Floor: Wasn't Xia Sang innocent last time?

3rd Floor: There are still people who actually believe that dog owner's denial? It's obviously fake.

4th Floor: Maybe it's just the two brothers together.

5th Floor: Poor Xiao Lin…

…

The others sitting below in the meeting room also gradually received the news and took out their phones to check.

Xia Sang froze upon seeing the photos. Within minutes, some images in the blog post had been blocked, but Xiao Lin had left some links that could still be clicked.

How desperate must someone be to post such photos online?

Xia Sang remembered Xiao Lin saying, "You're so lucky."

A pang of bitterness welled up inside Xia Sang.

Jin Fulai, standing nearby, immediately cursed, "Damn it, these people are insane! They don't even spare children! They have no shame!"

Bai Tinglin, on the other hand, looked terrified. He had once considered taking the wrong path, and some of his former targets were among them. He felt a wave of nausea rising in his throat.

In youth, one always seeks shortcuts, but convenient yet unfamiliar paths can easily cost you your life.

"Swish—" Liang Yiming stood up, grabbed Liang Yize, and led him out.

"The meeting is adjourned. Everyone can take a break," said Secretary Wang, staying behind. "Let's think about how to handle this matter. We'll continue the discussion when we get back."

Outside the meeting room, Liang Yiming dragged Liang Yize to the nearest fire escape stairwell and punched him in the face again.

Liang Yize cried miserably, snot and tears streaming down his face. His cheeks were even more swollen and red. Liang Yize, who usually cared so much about his image and dressed impeccably, now looked utterly hideous.

"Liang Yize, I had no idea you'd become like this these past few years," Liang Yiming said, squinting at his younger brother.

Liang Yize felt Liang Yiming's icy gaze upon him and roared angrily, "Brother, didn't you also keep Xia Sang? What's the difference between you and me!"

He frantically tried to justify himself, "I didn't really try to kill myself, and what Xiao Lin wrote wasn't entirely true. He just wanted revenge on me; he's too cunning!"

At this point, Liang Yize felt like vomiting blood. He had indeed tormented Xiao Lin, but Xiao Lin's portrayal of himself as a victim in that deep post disgusted him even more. Clearly, Xiao Lin had somehow found out he'd been with his brother's mistress and had offered himself up, now playing innocent. He had nowhere to turn but to keep quiet.

Watching Liang Yize continue his rambling, Liang Yiming's brows furrowed deeply. In an instant, his past feelings for Liang Yize seemed to fade.

"Snap—" Suddenly, a soft sound reached Liang Yiming's ears.
