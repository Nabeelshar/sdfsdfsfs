Chapter 2 02 Liang Ye's Itch (Revised)

Liang Yiming smiled faintly, recalling this, and stood up to say to Ye Bin, "I'll have someone contact you. As for whether it works out, that depends on her abilities."

"After all, Director Li is Chenxing's cash cow, and I have to respect him."

"Okay." Ye Bin smiled and waved, seeing Liang Yiming out the door. The boy sitting on the sofa could only grit his teeth and follow closely behind.

Liang Yiming returned to the villa from the hotel. He lay on the sofa, took out a cigarette from his pocket, his gaze following the drifting smoke, tapping his thigh lightly, showing no intention of acknowledging anyone.

The boy who had silently followed him back sat quietly beside him, constantly pondering in his mind.

His name was Bai Tinglin, a newly recruited artist from Liang's Entertainment Morning Star Company. A few days ago, he was assigned to work with Mr. Liang, without any explanation, only told to obey.

He obediently followed, but several days had passed, and Mr. Liang seemed completely unresponsive to him.

He watched as Mr. Liang's gloved hand rested on his thigh, his long, strong index finger tapping up and down his powerful, muscular thigh. The muscles beneath his suit trousers displayed sharp lines. Following the thigh upwards, his gaze fell upon a lean waist, a broad chest, a long neck, and a handsome face.

He couldn't help but swallow hard, his eyes gleaming. Such a rich and handsome patron—if he didn't take advantage of him now, who knew if he'd ever have another chance?

And just now, Master Liang had agreed to let his friend's lover try to get Director Li's role, but he hadn't agreed to his request yet, and he really wanted to try again.

"Master Liang," Bai Tinglin called out softly and gently to Master Liang.

Seeing that Liang Yiming didn't speak or react, Bai Tinglin reached out and lightly hooked his arm around Master Liang's chest.

Master Liang still didn't react.

Bai Tinglin's lips twitched. This man looked strong; could he be impotent?

He became bolder, until his chest was against Master Liang's arm and his face was resting on the other's shoulder, only then did Master Liang turn to look at him. He continued to try his best to please Master Liang.

Liang Yiming looked down at the boy's face, but felt nothing. He was decent-looking, but something felt off.

His body, however, acted against his will, a tingling itch spreading from his collarbone, a powerful urge to embrace him welling up from somewhere within him.

This uncontrollable feeling filled Liang Yiming with intense disgust.

What he didn't expect was that after two months, he would still remember Xia Sang, and he hadn't gotten used to it yet.

A nameless anger surged within Liang Yiming. He pushed Bai Tinglin away and said, "Get out."

"Master Liang, what's wrong?" Bai Tinglin asked hurriedly.

"You all get out." Liang Yiming looked up at the butler standing at the door. The butler immediately stepped forward to stop Bai Tinglin. "Mr. Bai, please go out for a moment."

"No...Master Liang, I'll sit still, I..."

Bai Tinglin was dragged out the door.

After everyone had left, Liang Yiming looked down at his trembling hands, feeling a burning itch and a dull ache in his heart. He longed to touch something warm, yet felt nauseous.

He took off his gloves, revealing large patches of scars stuck together beneath. Looking at those scars, it felt as if the burning heat was still spreading through his fingertips; the pain and itching were still there.

Liang Yiming took out another cigarette. As he lit it, he muttered, "Fuck, disgusting."

He smoked silently until the cigarette was almost finished. Looking at the orange-red embers, he thought of Xia Sang again.

He had always been a heavy smoker. Sometimes, work-related worries and skin cravings would occur simultaneously. No matter how hard he tried to resist, he would still smoke at least a pack a day. His family doctor had subtly warned him many times that smoking was bad for his health and treatment, but Liang Yiming continued as before.

It wasn't until two years ago, after Xia Sang listened to the family doctor and persistently tried to find ways to get him to smoke less, that he finally stopped.

But recently, he's been unconsciously twitching again…

Liang Yiming chuckled, took out his phone, and called his assistant. “How's Xia Sang doing?”

The reply was, “Working normally at the company.”

“Then why did he come to the Jinghao Hotel today?”

“Manager Jin took Mr. Xia downstairs to discuss a variety show guest appearance.”

“Did it go well?”

“I haven't heard any reports yet, probably not.”

“Contact him.”

There was a pause of a few seconds, then a quick reply, “Okay, understood.”

The scene of Xia Sang hiding behind a pillar that afternoon flashed through Liang Yiming's mind.

Did he think he could hide behind a pillar and I wouldn't see him? Doesn't he realize how big his fat manager's belly is?

Liang Yiming stubbed out his cigarette, brushed the ash from his fingers, put his gloves back on, and his expression returned to its usual cold indifference.

He had given Xia Sang a chance; it was Xia Sang who had acted recklessly in front of him.

Having failed to secure a spot on the variety show again, Brother Jin sighed and escorted Xia Sang back to her apartment.

Before leaving, he carefully instructed Xia Sang, "There's a gala tomorrow night. Even though the seats aren't great, we shouldn't miss any opportunity to get some exposure. I'll see if I can find a suitable chance to get closer to her."

Xia Sang obediently agreed.

The next day, Xia Sang woke up to a missed call. He glanced at the contact and muttered in surprise, "Secretary Zhang?"

Liang Yiming had an assistant team at the group company, consisting of two groups led by General Secretary Wang and Assistant General Manager Lin. General Secretary Wang handled daily operations and reception matters, while Assistant General Manager Lin coordinated and made decisions. Xia Sang used to communicate with General Secretary Wang and his team, and Secretary Zhang was Wang's subordinate. Once, when Liang Yiming asked Xia Sang to come to the company, it was Secretary Zhang who received him.

Xia Sang remembered him as a refined, handsome, and knowledgeable young man—or rather, all of Liang Yiming's assistants were highly regarded and of high quality.

Xia Sang called back, and Secretary Zhang answered quickly. "Mr. Xia, long time no see. Have you been busy lately? It's been ages since you last visited."

Hearing the hurried tone, Xia Sang was a little puzzled. He said softly, "Secretary Zhang, my contract with Mr. Liang has expired." So he definitely won't be coming to the group anymore.

"Is that so?" the other person asked in an exaggerated tone. "I was on a business trip recently and just got back, I didn't know."

"Hmm, thank you for your hard work."

"How have you been lately?"

"Not so good."

"What's wrong? Tell us if we can help you." (And maybe even create a plan for you and Mr. Liang to get back together.) Assistant Zhang looked at General Secretary Wang standing beside him with a smug expression.

"Um...is this convenient?"

"Yes, yes!"

"Do you have any suitable jobs you could recommend?" Xia Sang asked. "I'll treat them with the utmost care!"

Assistant Zhang couldn't help but smile. "That's easy, Mr. Xia, you just need to renew your contract with Mr. Liang."

"Hiss...didn't you guys notify me? Mr. Liang said he wouldn't renew."

"..." Zhang glanced at the general secretary beside him, then at the gossiping colleagues around him. No wonder they all wanted him to make the call!

"Is that so? But I heard Mr. Liang still wants to see you. What do you think?"

"Ah, no thanks." Xia Sang turned over on the bed.

"Why?"

"Didn't you tell me?"

Me? What does this have to do with me? Assistant Zhang glanced at his supervisor beside him, trembling. "When did I say you didn't want to renew the contract?"

"You showed me that stock you were really bullish on last time, saying it kept falling after I bought it, and you finally decided to sell." Xia Sang spoke slowly, word by word, as if recalling that day. "You said everyone was reluctant to sell because of sunk costs, but sometimes cutting your losses is the right choice. You have to look forward."

That day was Liang Yiming's birthday. Xia Sang and Liang Yiming had arranged to have dinner together that evening. He used the private entrance to wait for him in the meeting room.

Assistant Zhang was a little confused. What did their relationship have to do with his stock?!

He quickly tried to salvage the situation, saying, "Actually, I sold it, mainly because I wasn't optimistic about that stock anymore! Good stocks can rebound after hitting bottom!"

"Really?" Xia Sang asked, somewhat doubtfully. "But, since Master Liang doesn't need me anymore, a nobody like me should just stay put. The stock market is too high-class, too risky, not really suitable for me."

"No..."

"Brother Jin told me I want to be independent and self-reliant! To be an outstanding young person of the new era."

Mr. Xia, don't listen to everything you hear!

Xiao Zhang wanted to offer some more advice.

Just then, Xia Sang's phone rang again. He glanced at it and said to Xiao Zhang, "Secretary Xiao Zhang, I have to go now. Thank you for teaching me so much the other day. I'll treat you to dinner sometime." With that, the call ended.

Left alone on the other side, Xiao Zhang watched as his boss's expression changed drastically in an instant. The gentle demeanor vanished, replaced by a cold sneer as he glared at him, saying, "I remember last time you received Mr. Xia, it was because the meeting was delayed, and I couldn't come out, so you were the one who received him, right?"

"Yes," Xiao Zhang stammered nervously.

"Looking at stocks during work hours?" The general secretary, Wang, sneered again.

"I only glanced at it," Xiao Zhang tried to explain.

"One glance, and you taught Mr. Xia what sunk costs are, what timely loss-cutting is, and forced him to sell off our General Manager Liang."

I'll atone with my death!! Xiao Zhang silently wept inwardly.

"Go collect your fine and write a self-criticism," the general secretary slammed his hand on the table. "Hand it to me tomorrow."

"Yes, sir," Xiao Zhang slunk back to his workstation.

Liang Group's rooftop office. After reviewing a document, Liang Yiming pointed to Chief Secretary Wang. "What did Xia Sang say?"

"Mr. Xia hasn't agreed yet," Chief Secretary Wang gave a vague answer. "We're still in communication."

"Still in communication means she hasn't agreed?"

"Yes."

"The reason?" Liang Yiming frowned.

“Mr. Xia said, cough cough, he wants to be an independent and self-reliant young man.”

…Liang Yiming took a slight breath. “Where is he now?”

“Mr. Xia went to a party.”

“Do I have any work scheduled?”

“No, you can arrange to go now. The organizers sent us invitations.”

“Okay.”

“Alright, I’ll arrange a car to go now.” Before the words were finished, the office door was pushed open, and a cheerful voice called out, “Brother, where are you going?”

General Secretary Wang nodded and bowed. “Hello, Mr. Liang.”

“Hello, Secretary Wang, where are you going?” Liang Yize plopped down in the chair opposite Liang Yiming’s desk. General Secretary Wang smiled and looked at Mr. Liang.

“Why are you here?” Liang Yiming asked.

“I happened to be free today and wanted to have dinner with you,” Liang Yize said with a grin.

“I’m not free today.”

“Where are you guys going?”

“To a party.” Liang Yiming stood up and put on his suit jacket. Liang Yize quickly raised his hand to follow, “I’m going too.”

“Didn’t you say you were going to dinner?”

“I’m going with you, brother. It just means we’ll have dinner together!”

“Whatever.”

“Brother, you should bring a companion to these kinds of events, right?” Liang Yize circled around Liang Yiming. “And while you’re at it, give our company’s employees a promotion. I’ll arrange it, how about that?”

“Whatever.”

“Okay.”
