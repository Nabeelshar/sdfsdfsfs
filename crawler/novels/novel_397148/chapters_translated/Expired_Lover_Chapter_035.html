Chapter 55 35 First Time

Liang Yiming was exhausted after rushing through meetings and events. Sitting in the back seat of the car, eyes closed, his mind couldn't calm down.

Two days, 48 hours, 2880 minutes—meetings, transoceanic coordination… every minute and second was squeezed out.

But even the slightest pause, the smallest gap in his rest, would bring Xia Sang's image into his mind.

He had so much more to deal with. Liang Yiming rubbed his throbbing temples, trying to banish this inappropriate emotion. He had countless documents to sign, countless phone calls to make… He should go back to China to consider and deal with these issues.

Xia Sang was very well-behaved and obedient.

They truly felt they had wronged him in this matter.

But he was already in a hurry.

He was already making amends.

What else do you want?

Liang Yiming asked himself.

Call him again.

Liang Yiming looked at his phone, rolled down the car window, lit a cigarette, and the smoke billowed from his hand. The wind ruffled his hair, and his sharp eyes gazed into the distance.

What was so special about Xia Sang? Liang Yiming wondered.

Two years ago, he took Xia Sang away from the party on a whim.

An ordinary minor celebrity who was somewhat interesting and reasonably good-looking—or perhaps not even qualifying as a minor celebrity.

That night, he didn't think about anything happening.

He was restless, he had a certain longing, an itch in his heart, and just wanted someone to relieve it. First, he took a shower.

Xia Sang's face was still very green then, and he just stood there helplessly in the room.

He reached out and waved to Xia Sang.

Xia Sang was stunned for a moment, then hurriedly ran over. Just as he was about to lower his hand, Xia Sang grabbed his hand and politely gave him a handshake. "Mr. Liang, hello, I'm Xia Sang." As she spoke, she shook her hands up and down.

He remembered smiling at that moment.

For Xia Sang's lack of tact, and for Xia Sang's clumsiness.

Perhaps seeing his strange smile, Xia Sang seemed to know she had made a mistake.

He quickly let go, anxiously watching him. Seeing no reaction, he took his hand again, gently resting his face on it, his eyes searching for his response, cautiously asking if he'd done it right.

So obedient.

At that moment, he thought that if Xia Sang were an actor, she'd probably be a promising talent.

Of course, later he realized that with Xia Sang's acting skills, it was completely impossible; she really was that clumsy.

He clumsily tried to please him.

He climbed onto the sofa, opened his arms, wrapped them around his shoulders, and gave him a hug.

There was no ambiguity, no flirting.

That was the second time he smiled that night.

"How did you get here?" Liang Yiming asked, curiosity piqued at that moment.

Xia Sang released his grip, still sitting on Liang Yiming. "I need money."

"How much?"

"A lot." Xia Sang looked at him.

"Why?"

"...My grandmother is sick."

Liang Yiming looked at Xia Sang calmly, asking a few more questions in a nonchalant manner, quickly understanding her situation.

The original owner of this body was an orphan, with only her grandmother, destitute, possessing nothing but a pretty face and an almost foolish straightforwardness.

Her family had no power, no influence, no education, no ability.

Like a piece of paper easily crumpled and torn, too easy to manipulate.

If Xia Sang hadn't met Master Liang, perhaps she would have met someone else, or what would have happened to her—no one knows.

But at this moment, he was right in front of Liang Yiming.

Liang Yiming sized up Xia Sang.

Qin Lang always said he needed long-term, stable reassurance.

This one in front of him seemed quite agreeable.

He pulled the nervous, inexperienced Xia Sang closer, first kissing his cheek, then his lips…

…Perfect.

That's what he thought at that moment.

It was that perfect fit that led him to sign a long-term contract for the first time, even though it was just for that little bit of money.

He never expected Xia Sang to actually stay by his side for so long.

Liang Yiming took another deep breath, a subtle, suffocating feeling rising in his chest. Was it just perfect fit? What was causing the emotions churning in his chest…?

—The sudden ringing of a cell phone shattered the silence in the car. The name on the screen was "Lin Leman."

Liang Yiming had been working non-stop for the past two days, and Lin Leman had been calling constantly. Liang Yiming had only replied with a text message saying "Busy," and hadn't answered a single call.

Now that he wasn't answering, Lin Leman's calls wouldn't stop.

"Hello," Liang Yiming said, looking at Lin Leman on the video call.

"Yiming! Haven't you had enough?!" Lin Leman's voice came through the phone, filled with suppressed anger and confusion. "For a minor celebrity, you've gone to great lengths to intimidate me, even going so far as to target the higher-ups, and now you're not answering my calls. What are you trying to do? Declare war on me?" Her composed demeanor was almost crumbling.

Liang Yiming's dark eyes stared at Lin Leman. "You've overstepped your bounds. Chenxing isn't under your jurisdiction."

"He's just a lover," Lin Leman frowned, trying to argue.

"After you saw him that day, didn't you stay?" Liang Yiming suddenly asked.

Lin Leman looked at Liang Yiming in surprise. She had indeed encountered Xia Sang at the villa that day. She hadn't been able to get information from the general secretary, so she waited by the roadside for a while, but hadn't seen her come out by evening.

She couldn't help but believe what Liang Yize had said—that Liang Yiming had developed feelings for that young lover.

Lin Leman didn't directly answer Liang Yiming's question. She countered, "If it weren't for him, would you have cut off Yize's money and sent him to a juvenile detention center abroad?"

"No," Liang Yiming said calmly. “No?” Lin Leman didn’t believe it. “No, you would do this to your brother? When he was little, you doted on him the most, taking him home to care for him…”

Liang Yiming looked at Lin Leman with disappointment, realizing that after all these years, she had changed. This was still her true nature—so arrogant.

“Don’t you think Liang Yize made a mistake?” Liang Yiming said. “Is it because he’s too kind that others are retaliating against him?”

After saying that, Liang Yiming said bluntly, “I’m at the company. If there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up.”

“You!” Lin Leman was furious. “Liang Yiming, I’m your aunt!”

“So you took it upon yourself…” Liang Yiming’s tone was icy, “to humiliate someone like this at a time like this.”

“I’m doing this for your own good!” Lin Leman raised her voice. “So you’re forcing me to accept your views?” Liang Yiming said coldly.

“I…” Lin Leman looked into those eyes, exactly like her sister’s, and her heart tightened.

The once gentle twin sister had somehow become filled with obsession. “Xiaoman, it’s not that I forced him. If I didn’t force him, how would he grow? You don’t know how many people in the company are targeting me…”

She had sensed something was amiss, but she had let it go, allowing her to die in Liang Yiming’s room.

The scars on Liang Yiming’s hands, the illnesses in his body.

She also bore responsibility.
