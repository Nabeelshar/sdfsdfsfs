Chapter 45, 25 Medicines

On the other side, after reading Xiao Lin's profound lecture, Xia Sang felt restless and wanted to go out for some fresh air. He saw a group of people running towards the fire escape and followed them.

He saw Master Liang and Liang Yize. Liang Yize's face was swollen beyond recognition. Liang Yize was usually quite vain, and if the atmosphere hadn't been so tense, Xia Sang probably would have laughed.

He saw a man being pinned to the ground by staff. The man desperately clutched his chest, but several security guards eventually confiscated the camera from his hands.

"Take him for a body search. Check for any other filming equipment," Liang Yiming ordered.

It was a paparazzo who had sneaked in.

Not knowing the way, and having sneaked in, he happened to capture the scene of Liang Ye and Liang Yize fighting. This photo was already eye-catching enough, but he overheard even more.

"Xia Sang!" The paparazzi looked up and saw Xia Sang in the crowd, shouting, "I heard her! I heard Xia Sang!"

Xia Sang, unaware of what was happening, became somewhat nervous amidst the shouts and instinctively looked for Liang Yiming.

Liang Ye, following the sound, also saw Xia Sang in the crowd. His expression was ambiguous; he didn't speak, but simply had his staff take the paparazzi away.

The meeting continued, and Liang Ye didn't return. Only the General Secretary Wang entered the meeting room with two secretaries to attend the meeting and report in Liang Ye's place.

Even after the meeting ended, Mr. Liang, seated at the head of the table, didn't return to the meeting room. Xia Sang stared at the seat at the top, feeling lost and as if she had done something wrong.

Even sitting alone in the back seat of the car, Xia Sang still couldn't shake off the feeling, silently scrolling through her phone.

Jin Fulai, the driver, assumed she was still preoccupied with Xiao Lin's situation and turned the car around, heading towards the hospital.

Xia Sang asked curiously, "Where are you going, Brother Jin?"

"I don't know if paparazzi will be following you for the next few days," Brother Jin said. "I'm going to see your grandmother beforehand."

"Okay." Xia Sang thought for a moment, temporarily pulling herself out of her thoughts. "I don't think I've ever been chased by paparazzi before. Will it be exciting?" She'd only ever seen others being chased; she'd heard that some people even bought followers to track them down.

#Formerly a perennial minor actor, now a minor actor's manager, you ask me, I ask who?

"..." Jin Fulai exclaimed, "Having been eaten by pigs before, I've never seen a pig run away! If someone really chases you, I'd have to hire seven or eight bodyguards to protect you."

"Still need to be careful," Xiao Hong said sullenly. "Normal fans chasing you at the airport are fine, but those sasaeng fans and paparazzi are less dangerous."

Jin Fulai looked at Xiao Hong suspiciously. "How do you know?"

"I-I saw it on the news!" Xiao Hong quickly opened her phone. "There are tons of news like this."

Xiao Hong opened her phone; the screen showed notifications about Xiao Lin constantly being posted on various online platforms. Her voice unconsciously lowered as she spoke, "Brother Xia, are you very concerned about Xiao Lin?"

Xia Sang was stunned. Was he really that concerned? “Brother Xia, he released the snake himself, he did something wrong. Although I don’t know why he chose that way, it was his own choice,” Xiao Hong said firmly. He also felt sorry for Xiao Lin, but it was undeniable that he had tried to hurt others.

“I know, it’s just…” A strange sense of shared sorrow washed over him.

“Xia Sang, don’t overthink it.” Jin Fulai touched his face, recalling that although he wasn’t handsome back then, he still had a decent appearance. “When I was young, I was a martial arts actor. Once, the crew didn’t take proper safety precautions, and I fell and hurt my back. The doctor said I’d be in a wheelchair for life, but I still managed to stand up.” After that, he couldn’t do martial arts anymore, and spent many years playing supporting roles without ever rising to prominence.

“Still working as a manager, that's pretty good. Once you're settled, I'll find you a well-behaved and obedient successor.” Jin Fulai puffed out his thick chest and said slowly, “There are too many things in this world where right and wrong are indistinguishable. The worst thing for a person is regret; the more they regret, the more afraid they become. You have to bear the consequences of your own choices. As long as you look ahead, it might not be flowers, but it might not be a precipice either. You have to try.”

As long as you don't look back, and don't regret it, that's fine.

Suddenly, a surge of heat welled up in Xia Sang's eyes. He quickly lowered his head, his vision blurring. The two, then three, water droplets on his pants, blurred by the moisture in his heart, dripped and soaked.

After hearing this, Xiao Hong, sitting in the front row, pouted and her eyes welled up with tears. "Waaah, Brother Jin, I never knew you were so inspiring! I underestimated you before. I'll never scold you again."

"Get lost, don't disgust me." Brother Jin looked at her with disgust. He was a staunchly straight man with a very unappealing aesthetic, and he didn't like Xiao Hong's somewhat effeminate, jingling outfit at all.

"And I knew I sneeze all the time, you were talking about me." Brother Jin reached out to pinch Xiao Hong's ear, but she quickly dodged, yelling, "Brother Jin! Watch where you're going! My life and Xia Ge's life are in your hands!"

Watching the two of them laughing and joking, Xia Sang felt much better.

Upon arriving at the hospital, before getting out of the car, Jin Fulai tugged at the collar of his suit, which he had specially worn to the meeting that day. "If all else fails, we can go back and film some borderline videos. A million per video, that'll make a lot of money."

Xia Sang/Xiao Hong: ...

As expected of Brother Jin, he immediately thought of a backup plan.

As night fell, Liang Yiming was working on documents in the study of the old villa when Miss Lin, Lin Leman, arrived.

"Auntie, why are you here so late?" Liang Yiming put down the documents in his hand.

"I heard that Yize went to the detention center." Lin Leman placed her bag on the sofa, her delicate eyebrows furrowed. "What happened to that child?"

"I don't know." Liang Yiming reached for a cigarette in the drawer, but stopped when he saw Lin Leman.

“Could it be a misunderstanding? Should we make some arrangements?” Lin Leman asked.

Liang Yiming snorted. “Let him stay put. If he did something wrong, he should bear the consequences.”

Lin Leman sighed. This implied Liang Yize had committed a crime. “If he didn’t do something serious, you were the one who helped him establish himself in the Liang family back then. You had such a good relationship; you should help him if you can.”

“Auntie, don’t get involved in this,” Liang Yiming said, looking at Lin Leman. “The authorities will have a result. Someone who dares to ruin someone is just pathetic.”

Lin Leman was taken aback by the retort, her expression darkening. “I heard you transferred money to a paparazzi?”

“Yes, I was talking to Liang Yize when…” "I heard you." Liang Yiming tapped his fingertips lightly on the table, his thoughts instantly returning to the afternoon…

"Mr. Liang, confiscating the equipment is useless; we all synchronize via the cloud."

That paparazzi was notorious, famously difficult to deal with. "Of course, if you don't pay me, no problem. This little bit of news won't really affect you, Mr. Liang.

Fortune favors the bold. I can only try to find that minor celebrity; maybe he has money.

After all, being a celebrity exposes some of their privacy, and we ordinary people have a certain right to know about the commercial nature of celebrities."

Public opinion always tends to gravitate towards the negative.

Xia Sang had already trended once; another trending topic of the same type…

"How much?" Liang Yiming asked expressionlessly.

The paparazzi grinned and gestured a number. That amount meant absolutely nothing to Mr. Liang.

But the moment he handed over the check, anger surged within him. The feeling of being manipulated and suppressed was like a mountain pressing down on him, suffocating, painful, and unbearable.

That feeling even extended to the person who mentioned it.

“Auntie, it’s late, you should go home,” Liang Yiming said directly, dismissing her. “Auntie, how long until you finish your domestic business?”

“You’re kicking me out?” Lin Leman asked in surprise, staring intently at Liang Yiming, as if trying to understand why he would treat her this way. "Just because I mentioned that paparazzi?"

Liang Yiming closed his eyes briefly. "I'm tired." He stood up and walked to Lin Leman's side. Lin Leman looked up at him and noticed the dark circles under his eyes again. Heartache overwhelmed her, and she stood up, grabbing her bag.

"Still can't sleep?" Lin Leman asked.

"Yes."

"I don't think that minor celebrity is anything special. If you like her, your aunt can find you a similar young master or heiress. Talk to her."

Liang Yiming, his face dark, saw Lin Leman out.

Lin Leman herself wasn't getting married, but seeing her nephew alone, with his parents gone, she still longed for someone to keep him company.

Before leaving, she gave him a few more words of advice.

Back in his study, Liang Yiming couldn't resist smoking, his head throbbing, an intense itch coursing through his body.

He smoked, trying to suppress his desire.

His personal phone flashed a few times. He picked it up and saw a message from Xia Sang—"Mr. Liang, nothing happened this afternoon, right?"

Liang Yiming scrolled up; it was all Xia Sang's everyday stories and photos of him with Robles.

But what he really thought was that some things should be cut short. If he hadn't renewed his contract with Xia Sang, perhaps none of this would have happened.

He was wrong. He'd indulged his body and made a mistake.

Liang Yiming turned off his phone, tossed it on the desk, and didn't reply.

The next day, Xia Sang went downstairs to buy something. As soon as he stepped out of his apartment, he noticed someone secretly filming him with a camera. Several bolder individuals rushed up to him, asking, "Mr. Xia, hello, what are your thoughts on Mr. Xiao Lin's death?"

"How is your relationship with the guest who is the 'Intern Dad'?"

"Has Mr. Liang from Morning Star Entertainment sexually harassed you?"

"You were previously exposed for having ties to the Liang Group, was it really just about keeping dogs?"

Several microphones were shoved in front of Xia Sang, startling him so much that he quickly covered his face and mouth, nearly swallowing the microphone.

Fortunately, Jin Fulai and Xiao Hong followed Xia Sang downstairs, shielding her from the fire. The group quickly entered the apartment, but after waiting for a long time, the crowd downstairs remained. These people were really going all out for their sales targets.

"I asked my friend, and he said your place is surrounded by people now. I guess you can't get back. I never thought I'd be able to be a bodyguard again," Jin Fulai said with a sigh. He knew that a minor celebrity was just like any other passerby on the street. "Or I could stay in a hotel or somewhere, but hotels are always crowded and noisy."

If it were before, he could stay at Grandpa Liang's house, but now that it's so sensitive, he definitely couldn't go there.

"I'm staying in a private house, but that's not very safe either," Jin thought. "Then let's go to Xiao Hong's house."

"My house??" Xiao Hong exclaimed in surprise.

"What?" Jin Fulai recalled, "Didn't your job posting say you were working in Royal Bay? Lots of celebrities live in that complex, its security is guaranteed."

Xiao Hong looked hesitant.

"Is your boyfriend there?"

"No!"

"Then what are you afraid of?" Jin Fulai looked at Xiao Hong suspiciously, "I've always felt something was off, like you're hiding something."

"No way!" Xiao Hong bristled.

"If there's nothing wrong, let us go!" When the three of them arrived at Xiao Hong's doorstep, she was still hesitant, but finally opened the door, "I told you, you can't ask me anything you see."

Jin Fulai looked at the long lenses and tripods Xiao Hong had in the living room, "Is this what you call being a fan?"

Xia Sang also looked at Xiao Hong curiously, "Which celebrity do you like? I've never heard you say."

Xiao Hong stammered.

"You're applying for a job at Morning Star Entertainment?" Jin Fulai recalled the details of Xiao Hong's interview. "No, you said you interviewed at many companies but didn't get the job."

"Two years ago, when you first joined, you were quite enthusiastic after get off work; we couldn't even get you to come for dinner. When did you start having noodles with us every day for dinner?" Jin Fulai counted the days on his fingers, "May, June..."

"Stop counting, I'll take care of it." "It's collapsed! It's collapsed!" Xiao Hong screamed in despair. "Alright, alright, waaaaah!"

"Who is it?"

"xxx"

"Huh?" Upon hearing this, Brother Jin burst into laughter. "Hahahaha, so you like this kind of thing. Other celebrities can debut with a baby-faced, cute boy image. I didn't expect that you, Xiao Hong, tall and strong, would like this type. You're not a pervert either, are you?"

"Get lost! I'm a mom fan! A mom fan!" Xiao Hong frantically pulled at the records and photos on her phone, trying to prove her former fandom. But after unlocking the phone, she suddenly screamed, "Ah! Ahhh!"

"What's wrong? Looking at your ugly face?" Brother Jin was still laughing at Xiao Hong.

Xiao Hong shook her head frantically, stammering in fear, "No! It's...it's Grandpa Liang!"

"What?" Xia Sang looked at Xiao Hong. What happened to Grandpa Liang?

"Grandpa Liang, what's wrong?" Jin Fulai, who was nearby, snatched Xiao Hong's phone.

The news notification on her phone was—a new anti-cancer drug from the Liang Group caused the deaths of eight people, and their families are now demanding an explanation at the hospital…

The news comment section exploded.

1st Floor: Holy crap, the Liang Group is killing people!!

2nd Floor: This is a bombshell! A bombshell!! First there was driving someone to suicide, now there's drug-induced death.

3rd Floor: Has the world gone mad, or am I?
