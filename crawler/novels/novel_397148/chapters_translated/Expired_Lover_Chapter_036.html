Chapter 56 36 Boldness

Lin Leman looked at Liang Yiming, proactively feigning weakness, "I didn't mean to, Yiming."

Liang Yiming didn't speak. He looked at Lin Leman's panicked expression, perhaps for a few seconds, perhaps longer, and said wearily, "We'll talk about it when I get back to China. I'm tired."

After saying that, he hung up the phone and lay down on the bed for a short nap.

These past few days of non-stop work had left his mind muddled, his consciousness wavering, and he was exhausted but unable to truly fall asleep.

Irritable.

In his hazy state, he heard—a deep, deep knock

Someone was knocking on the door.

He frowned, got up, and opened the door. Standing under the orange-yellow hallway light was none other than Xia Sang.

He was wearing a light-colored T-shirt and jeans, his soft hair falling over his forehead, his bright eyes looking at him.

He called out to him timidly, "Grandpa Liang," just like back then.

Liang Yiming was somewhat taken aback. He paused, then sensed something was off. "Xia Sang?"

Xia Sang stepped forward and hugged him, crying, "Grandma passed away, why didn't you come…"

Liang Yiming felt a dampness settle over his chest. He didn't realize his expression softened unconsciously.

Just as that embrace was about to happen, more questions made his reason uneasy.

Xia Sang, how did she get here? How did she know the place? How did she find his room? Why didn't Secretary Wang report it? How could she arrive so quickly…?

No, no.

He suddenly opened his eyes.

What met his gaze was the hotel's pristine white ceiling and the cold, expensive, exquisite lights hanging from it.

It was all a dream.

Liang Yiming's eyes widened in horror. Had he gone mad? He admitted they had made a mistake.

But how could he have imagined such a foolish thing?

Liang Yiming desperately tried to deny his fantasy, but the intense, itchy thirst in his skin flared up again, this time like the gnawing of ants, a torment of desire and reason tearing at each other.

Xia Sang is a good person.

But he only found a lover because of his illness; this shouldn't affect him.

...
Two days later, Secretary Zhang waited anxiously in the departure lounge of City B airport.

He didn't know if Mr. Liang had seen the message. By the time he found out yesterday, Mr. Liang had already boarded the plane.

Xiao Zhang was furious. Xia Sang's agent was too wicked. Xia Sang was leaving City B without telling him, and even used the excuse of not wanting to disturb Xia Sang to keep him from contacting her. It was truly despicable.

Soon, Xiao Zhang saw Mr. Liang in the departure lounge and quickly took his luggage. He saw that Mr. Liang's expression was normal.

After a moment's hesitation, he finally spoke slowly, "Mr. Liang, I don't know if you've seen the message—Mr. Xia has already left City B."

Liang Yiming glanced down at Xiao Zhang, didn't answer, just nodded, and then got into the back seat.

Xiao Zhang, the secretary, looked at Mr. Liang with some curiosity the whole way.

Didn't the boss say Mr. Liang was very worried about Xia Sang? Why is his expression and reaction like this after finding out?

"Mr. Liang, should we check where Xia Sang went?"

"No need," Liang Yiming replied.

"Oh, oh, okay." Xiao Zhang pulled her head back.

Liang Yiming continued looking at the data. He already knew Xia Sang had left City B when he checked his phone after getting off the plane.

He told himself he hadn't returned for Xia Sang, so her presence or absence was irrelevant.

Even after taking Master Liang back to the Liang family's old house, Xiao Zhang hadn't received any further instructions from him. He found this strange, but could only leave.

Back at the old house, Robles immediately rushed over. Having not seen him for a while, Robles was unusually enthusiastic. Liang Yiming patted its head, finally showing a slight smile.

That night, Liang Yiming held Robles as he rested. Usually, Robles was there for company, but tonight, Liang Yiming couldn't fall asleep.

He sat up. The moon was hidden tonight. He looked around the familiar room, darkness enveloping the entire space. After scanning the room, his gaze settled on the crack in the bathroom door. Liang Yiming took out a cigarette.

Aside from a few close acquaintances, no one knew his mother had died in this room. Her voice was shrill, filled with fear and pain…

“Yiming! What are you doing?!”

“I told you! You can’t go out without my permission! Don’t you know how dangerous it is outside?!”

“Your father and brother are gone! Instead of studying, what are you doing! Why are you so useless?”

“…Yiming…Mom…Mom didn’t mean it…”

“Without me, how can you be a carefree young master?”

…
The sounds echoed throughout the night.

“Good day, Master Liang.” The next day, Liang Yiming arrived at Morning Star Entertainment, where several senior executives were already waiting to greet him at the entrance.

"Everyone's already in the meeting room." The other person lowered their eyes, fearing trouble at this crucial moment.

Meanwhile, Jin Fulai and Xiao Hong, also parties involved, were invited to the meeting room and sat down, watching Liang Ye's tall and imposing figure take the seat of honor.

After taking their seats, Liang Ye didn't waste a single word, launching into a thunderous meeting of criticism and appointments.

The general manager was implicated and punished, and the HR manager was fired.

Everyone was trembling with fear.

Watching Liang Yiming's performance, Xiao Hong gritted her teeth and said, "What's the point of doing this now?"

Jin Fulai glanced at her, "Keep your voice down."

If someone hears them, it'll be troublesome. More than anything, Jin Fulai wanted to know what Master Liang's actions meant.

Was it because this underhanded behavior offended him, and he was getting revenge, or did he have feelings for Xia Sang?

Unfortunately, Master Liang didn't ask about Xia Sang at all during the entire meeting.

After the meeting ended, everyone waited for Master Liang to leave, departing in order of rank.

Jin Fulai and Xiao Hong were at the back. Most of the people in front had left. Turning a corner, they saw Master Liang still waiting at the elevator entrance.

Jin Fulai turned around and tried to pull Xiao Hong away.

Unexpectedly, Liang Yiming spoke, "Xia Sang, are you alright?"

His mind went blank for a moment. Jin Fulai hurriedly replied, "I'm fine, I'm fine." He wondered what Liang Yiming meant. Was he going to sideline him again?

But Xia Sang was gone now.

He waited for what Liang Yiming would say next, but Liang Yiming remained silent. When the elevator arrived, he walked straight in, but before Liang Yiming had taken two steps, he heard someone say from behind.

"You still have the nerve to ask? Belated affection is worthless."

These words caused an instant silence.

Jin Fulai stared wide-eyed at Xiao Hong. Liang Yiming stood there for a few seconds without turning around, then strode away with even greater strides. Seeing the elevator doors close and Boss Liang leave, Brother Jin quickly grabbed Xiao Hong, "Wow, how dare you be so bold today!"

"Hmph," Xiao Hong said, arms crossed, "Brother Jin, haven't you heard of 'fuck you money'? Now that I have the money Brother Xia gave me, I can fire my boss anytime."

"...Your 'fuck you money' came from the person you fucked."

Xiao Hong bared her teeth, "I don't care, just looking at his face makes me angry. If it weren't for them, would Brother Xia have left?!" She then glanced at Brother Jin, "Don't boost others' morale while diminishing your own."

Jin Fulai pointed at Xiao Hong, "Hey, you Hao Hong, indiscriminate attacking, huh?!"

[Author's Note]

Xiao Hong, you're so bold!
