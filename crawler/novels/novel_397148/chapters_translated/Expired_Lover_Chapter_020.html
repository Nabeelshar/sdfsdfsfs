Chapter 39 20 Standoff (Revised)

"Alright, get her to the hospital immediately." The accompanying doctor cleaned and adjusted Xingxing's body again.

The director and crew scattered frantically, putting her in the car and rushing to the hospital.

With the biggest crisis resolved, everyone's minds began to race, speculating about Xia Sang's identity. Those living in this villa district were all incredibly wealthy and powerful; how could Xia Sang have the villa's access code? And know there was serum inside?

Could Xia Sang be some kind of rich second-generation? Impossible. If she were, she wouldn't have been so unknown before, and her resources wouldn't have been so limited.

Then there's only one explanation.

The "Intern Dad Variety Show Accident" was already trending, and now Xia Sang is trending along with it.

Comments:

1st Floor: The most upscale villa area in City B, need we say more?

2nd Floor: Although Xia Sang did save Xingxing, but…

3rd Floor: Damn it, stop speculating, okay? It's about saving lives!!!

4th Floor: Could it be a staged accident? He was bitten by a snake, and there's antivenom right away…

5th Floor: Wasn't Xia Sang's background already exposed? He's just an orphan, and a nobody. Can he afford to live here?

7th Floor: Could he be being kept?

8th Floor: Can you guys have some decency?! Xia Sang is obviously a good person! Online discussions erupted, and many began digging into the background of the villa Xia Sang had entered.

Soon, netizens discovered it belonged to the Liang Group, and further investigation revealed that the group's owner was residing there, instantly exposing Mr. Liang to the public eye.

Xia Sang watched her phone buzz with messages. Mr. Liang had just hung up and hadn't called back.

Jin Ge's phone kept ringing, but he was still live-streaming. Xia Sang hung up and sent him a message.

The director answered a phone call, then pointed the camera at Xingxing, indicating that the child was alright and the live stream was over. They would continue to update Xingxing's recovery on the program's official Weibo account in real time. Although netizens were dissatisfied, the production team forcibly shut down the live stream. For the sake of follow-up, the camera continued to film, but only focused on Xingxing.

【We're doomed! We're doomed!】

【Xia Sang, how could you be so bold?!】

【You actually took someone to Master Liang's place?】

【You've really gone mad! Now the whole internet is guessing you're being kept by Master Liang, do you know that?!】

Jin Ge's messages were popping up like crazy.

Xia Sang tapped the screen for a long time, then deleted it.

Jin Fulai was furious at the "typing..." message in the chat box; he'd typed for ages, but nothing came of it.

【I'm coming to pick you up from the hospital. Send me the address.】

Xia Sang saw Jin's message and quickly sent the address.

Jin Fulai rushed to the hospital with Xiao Hong. When he saw Xia Sang in the parking lot, his anger flared. He was about to yell at her when he saw her see them, tears welling up in her eyes as she cried silently.

Jin Fulai felt a pang of sadness, and the words of scolding stuck in his throat. He could only hug her and pat her head.

Although his handling of the situation was flawed, he knew it was Xia Sang's sincerity.

The only question was how to explain it to Master Liang.

Jin Fulai, thinking of the online uproar, could only pray for Liang Ye's divine intervention.

Liang Yiming, watching the phone call Xia Sang had hung up on, felt a surge of anger.

He couldn't understand what Xia Sang was thinking.

His actions were tantamount to ruining his future.

Liang Yiming watched the internal video on his phone, which showed them taking the child to the hospital, where the child received treatment and seemed to be out of danger.

Liang Yiming's tightly furrowed brows remained furrowed.

The CEO's secretary, Wang, handed him a tablet; the screen was filled with speculation about Xia Sang's identity, the comments increasing rapidly and escalating.

"Take the hype down little by little, don't suppress it too much at once, control public opinion." Liang Yiming glanced around casually and instructed, "Also, have the entertainment company and Liang Yize come over immediately."

"I'll contact the entertainment company right away." Upon receiving Liang's instructions, General Secretary Wang immediately made the call to arrange things. Someone pushed open the door—it was Lin Leman.

She was wearing a black belted dress and high heels, followed by her assistant. She walked in with a "tap tap tap" sound. "Yiming, what's going on?"

Liang Yiming told General Secretary Wang to go out and make the call. "Aunt Lin."

"I saw online that the program crew almost had an accident, and they even dragged you into it." Lin Leman pursed her lips, her expression slightly angry. "How did the company's public relations department handle it?"

"Aunt Lin, please sit down." Liang Yiming gestured for Lin Leman to sit on the sofa. "They're already communicating with them. It was live at the time, so they couldn't control it immediately."

Xiao Zhang, arranged by Secretary Wang, came in to serve tea. Lin Leman sat down, took the tea, and chuckled, "That production team has absolutely no sense of propriety."

Then she put down her teacup. "And that Xia Sang, even worse, ran straight to your villa. Is he afraid people won't know you're keeping him?"

Liang Yiming remained silent.

Lin Leman continued, "Keeping a lover for two years is about enough, and this time he's caused such a big mess. If you ask me, this person can't be kept; we should just get rid of him."

Liang Yiming smiled. "Who's been gossiping about you?"

Lin Leman paused; Liang Yiming didn't immediately answer her.

This reminded her of what Liang Yize had said—that Master Liang cared about Xia Sang.

"Who said that?" Lin Leman chuckled. "I just see this child always causing you trouble, and I think it's inappropriate."

"Aunt Lin, you don't need to worry about that," Liang Yiming said, standing up to return to his desk.

Lin Leman quickly stood up. "Yiming, your aunt is doing this for your own good."

"Auntie, I know what I'm doing. You can go back now." Liang Yiming picked up his tablet, looking at the comments one by one. He said, "I'll handle it myself."

Lin Leman could only leave, but she felt even more dissatisfied with Xia Sang.

Soon, executives from Morning Star Entertainment Company entered with the director team of Liang Yiming's intern father. Liang Yize, who usually entered the office first, was the last today.

Everyone greeted Liang Yiming respectfully upon entering. Liang Yiming didn't respond. His first words were, "I want to know why a snake appeared."

No one answered for a moment.

"I want to know why this accident happened."

The director opened his mouth but didn't dare to speak.

Grandpa Liang tapped the table with the nib of his pen. "Something happened, and you don't even dare take responsibility? What use are you then!" Liang Yiming angrily threw the pen to the ground, the expensive pen shattering into pieces.

The director quickly explained, "We cleaned the outdoor area according to procedure. Nobody knows how there got a snake. Grandpa Liang, it was indeed an accident. Accidents are normal in variety shows."

"Normal? Someone died! Is that normal or not?!" Liang Yiming looked at Liang Yize sitting at the table.

"It's all our fault. Whether it was an accident or negligence, we didn't do a proper inspection, we didn't take proper emergency measures."

Liang Yize bowed, and everyone else followed suit, bowing their heads in apology and admitting their mistakes.

"And then?"

The head of public relations handed over a proposal. "This is our new solution..."

Master Liang quickly glanced through it, and the others quickly added that they would offer appropriate compensation and apologies to the victims, and that the hype was already being suppressed. Regarding the rumors between Master Liang and Xia Sang, they had already guided public opinion, and for now, things were fine. The main issue was Xia Sang's case, which was more complicated, and they were all looking for solutions.

After listening to all the information, Master Liang said, "Punishment will be announced later. You can all go back now. Liang Yize, you stay."

Only Liang Yize remained at his desk. His palms were sweating, and he could hear his own heart pounding like a drum.

Liang Yiming asked, "Is Xiao Lin one of your men?"

"No..." Liang Yize hadn't finished denying it.

"Then Secretary Wang's investigation was wrong." Liang Yiming looked at Liang Yize with a dark face. "I'll have him investigate again."

"No!" Liang Yize shouted, "He is... one of my men, but I didn't instruct him to do this kind of thing!"

Liang Yiming looked at him, and Liang Yize continued to explain, "I only asked him to trip me up a bit. I absolutely didn't do anything to hurt anyone. Brother, believe me."

"Then what about your promise to take care of Xia Sang?"

Liang Yiming hated being lied to.

"I..." Liang Yize couldn't explain.

"Some things from before, were you doing them on purpose...?"

"I..."

Seeing Liang Yize's flustered expression, Liang Yiming felt a burning sensation in his palm beneath his gloves. He thought he was impartial, but in reality, he was being used.

His mind raced, screaming, "My mother's words! No one else can be trusted! They'll all harm you!"

The burning pain in his palm intensified. He slammed his hand on the table. "Get out!"

He felt anger and betrayal.

Liang Yize opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but Liang Yiming cut him off, "Don't make me say it a second time."

Liang Yiming's gaze made Liang Yize back down. His brother had never looked at him like that before.

He left the office dejectedly, head down. As soon as he stepped outside, all his resentment turned to another person—Xiao Lin, you've got guts! I'll kill you!

After everyone left, Liang Yiming stared blankly out the window, his thoughts unreadable. He sat there, his broad shoulders beneath his black suit, his posture perpetually upright. The bustling traffic and towering skyscrapers outside the floor-to-ceiling windows became his backdrop.
