Chapter 72 47 Taking a Bath

Xia Sang hadn't expected that Master Liang would actually go with her, and not only Master Liang, but also his housekeeper Liu, cook Huang, and even Doctor Qin.

Upon arriving in G City, Xia Sang and Master Liang sat together on the way up the mountain.

The mountain road was somewhat rugged. To comfort Grandpa Liang, Xia Sang kept talking to him, describing the scenery along the way. "We're about to get off the highway."

"After getting off the highway, we still have a three-hour drive."

"We're going to my grandma's house."

"But there's no one home at grandma's house anymore."

"Ah, we're at the foot of the mountain now; it might be a little shaky."

...

Upon arriving, Xia Sang discovered another problem: these places were mostly farmhouses. He had originally stayed in Chen Anyang's vacant house, but it only had two single rooms.

There wasn't enough room for so many people. Fortunately, there were empty spaces in the neighboring farmhouse. Xia Sang called Sister Juan to help communicate.

He explained the situation to everyone.

Because Mr. Liang disliked others getting close, it was ultimately decided that he and Xia Sang would continue living in their original house. Butler Liu and Aunt Huang would look for a place nearby, visiting regularly each day, and contacting them by phone for any other matters.

"This is where I live," Xia Sang said, leading everyone into the house. The house was simply furnished. Although Butler Liu and Aunt Huang were an ordinary family, they had always lived in the city and rarely stayed in rural houses.

Besides a TV and a wooden sofa, the living room...

"Xia, you're living here?" Mrs. Huang asked with concern. "It's too simple."

"Mrs. Huang, you can't worry," Xia Sang replied. "You'll be living with us in this kind of house. You might not be used to it at first, but the air is very good. You'll get used to it."

"Yes, yes, yes."

After they finished speaking, they went out first. "Sir, we'll stay in the next room. Please call us if you need anything."

Xia Sang's house was only one story, and most areas could be accessed by wheelchair.

Xia Sang first showed Liang Yiming around the house. Although Liang Yiming couldn't see, Xia Sang still enthusiastically explained everything.

"This is the kitchen, this is the bedroom, this is another bedroom..." The place wasn't big, and he quickly finished introducing it. "It's not as big as Grandpa Liang's villa, but it has a small garden. I picked a lot of things from the mountain to plant."

Xia Sang looked at the garden full of wildflowers and weeds and said happily, "I'm quite talented."

Leaving Xia Sang and Liang Yiming alone, just as Xia Sang was feeling awkward...

"Xia Sang!"

A cheerful young man's voice came from outside the door.

"You're back? My mom cut you a watermelon!"

"An Yang, just a moment." Xia Sang pushed Grandpa Liang into the living room.

Chen Anyang, carrying a plate of watermelon, entered the living room and saw a handsome man in a black casual shirt sitting in a wheelchair. He had an extraordinary air about him and clearly came from a wealthy family.

"Xia Sang, who is this?" Chen Anyang asked. He only knew Xia Sang had returned today, but didn't know she had brought so many people with her.

Who is this?

Xia Sang thought for a moment, considering Grandpa Liang's current status, and finally said, "My ex-boss."

"Ex-boss?"

"Yes… haha." Xia Sang racked her brains for an explanation, "I used to work as a nanny. My boss isn't feeling well and came here to relax."

"Oh, so you're taking care of him?" "Chen Anyang looked at the two of them and asked, unusually.

"No, no, several assistants also live around here," Xia Sang quickly changed the subject. "My boss's surname is Liang."

"Hello, I'm Xia Sang's landlord, Anyang." Xia Anyang stepped forward, wanting to shake Mr. Liang's hand.

Xia Sang swiftly grabbed Xia Anyang's hand, and Xia Anyang blushed and froze on the spot. "Why are you grabbing my hand?"

"Hahaha, my boss doesn't like being touched by others," Xia Sang explained.

"Woof!" A yellow dog emerged from behind Chen Anyang.

"Big Yellow, you're here too." Xia Sang reached out and stroked Da Huang's head. Da Huang was a yellow Chinese rural dog, called a "tugou" (local dog) here.

Liang Yiming heard Xia Sang call the dog "Da Huang," a common and rustic name.

So Xia Sang also took care of a dog for someone in this small mountain village, Liang Yiming thought.

After chatting for a few minutes, Chen Anyang left. As he left, he turned back and saw Xia Sang squatting down, turning her head to talk to her boss, and something seemed off.

That evening, when it was time to take a bath, Xia Sang felt embarrassed. He timidly asked Liang Ye, "Liang Ye, how do you usually take a bath?"

"In a bathtub." "

But… this dilapidated house isn't Grandpa Liang's luxurious villa; it doesn't have something as luxurious as a bathtub.

“There's no bathtub here.”

Xia Sang's mind raced. “Should I get Aunt Zhao's youngest son's basin from next door?”

Before Liang Yiming could reply, Xia Sang had already pictured Grandpa Liang, tall and strong, stuffing himself into the child's bathtub. It was so hilarious that she couldn't help but laugh out loud.

He didn't notice that when he laughed, Liang Yiming, who had been silent all along, looked a little displeased.

It wasn't until he looked at Liang Yiming, suppressing his laughter, that he abruptly stopped, realizing that he might have offended Grandpa Liang.

He opened his mouth several times before finally explaining, “Grandpa Liang, I wasn't laughing at you.” "I...I just...I just have low emotional intelligence, really low emotional intelligence! Haha, haha."

"..." Hearing this, Liang Yiming felt even more frustrated and had nowhere to vent his anger. Xia Sang was right; he knew she could be impulsive and naive at times.

The headaches he had experienced dealing with Xia Sang in the past returned to Liang Yiming.

He sighed.

Xia Sang hurriedly said, "Master Liang, should I ask Butler Liu to bathe you?"

Seeing that Master Liang's expression was still not good, she immediately added, "No, no, I'll bathe you. You sit there, I'll bathe you. Tomorrow I'll have Butler Liu buy a large bathtub." "The house is small, so installing another bathtub isn't practical, but buying a large bathtub would solve the bathing problem."

Xia Sang spoke frankly, but when Liang Yiming actually undressed there, she couldn't help but blush, muttering, "How can he be so open..."

After leaving Grandpa Liang, he had been busy in town for a long time and hadn't thought about those things.

Xia Sang cursed herself inwardly; she had actually had such thoughts about a patient, she was truly worse than an animal.

Besides, her relationship with Grandpa Liang was no longer that kind of relationship. She had to realize her place.

Xia Sang berated herself while trying to convince herself otherwise.

But when she actually touched Grandpa Liang's body, Xia... Sang's mind went completely blank.

His first impression was that Master Liang had lost a lot of weight, and the muscles in his arms were thinner.

He looked down at Master Liang's sparse hair, feeling a pang of sadness.

How painful it must be for Master Liang, such a proud man, to have fallen to this state.

Liang Yiming felt Xia Sang's hands against his skin; her palms were rougher than before. He recalled that when Xia Sang first got together, her hands were also rough, with a scar on her palm, which had become much smoother over time.

Now, there was a thin callus.

The friction of her palms against his skin caused a slight stinging and itching sensation. It seemed that Xia Sang hadn't been doing well these past few years.

"How much money do you want?" “Liang Yiming said.

Xia Sang looked at Liang Yiming with suspicion. Why did he suddenly bring up money?

Liang Yiming continued, “Although I asked you to help me, I will pay you.”

“How much?” Xia Sang asked curiously.

“You tell me.”

He was quite easy to talk to, but Xia Sang didn't seem to be short of money now.

Besides, she and Master Liang were friends now.

She had invited Master Liang over as a friend, not under contract.

“I don’t need it.”

If he didn’t need money, then what did he need?

Itchy. Liang Yiming felt even itchier.

“You can leave,” Liang Yiming said. “I’ll wash myself.” Hearing Xia Sang leave, Liang Yiming wiped his face, feeling an excitement rising within him.

Outside the bathroom door, Liang Yiming didn't see that Xia Sang's face was also flushed.
