Chapter 59 39 Phone Calls

He pushed the door open, dressed in a white silk Tang suit. A pair of glossy jade balls he held in his hands made a faint, unsettling rubbing sound. Seeing Liang Yiming lying on the bed, the man's eyes crinkled into deep smiles: "Oh, my good nephew! I was so worried when I heard you were in trouble! How are you? Feeling better?"

It was Liang Jinfeng.

He walked in, speaking as he went, followed by his assistant carrying several bags of what appeared to be expensive tonics. He took them and handed them to Liang Yiming, saying, "These are tonics for you. Take good care of your health."

The moment Liang Jinfeng spoke, Liang Yiming immediately closed his eyes and lay down, saying, "I need to rest now. I don't receive guests."

The gift box placed on the bedside table hung in mid-air.

Liang Jinfeng's smile instantly froze. His chubby cheeks slanted downwards, giving him a more fierce look.

But he maintained his smile: "Look at my memory, the patient really needs more rest. But nephew..." He gently placed the gift box on the bedside table, the jade ball stopping spinning in his palm, "...it's always better to be humble, lest you be caught in a trap."

Liang Yiming's eyes were closed, motionless, as if he were already asleep.

Liang Jinfeng stared at Liang Yiming's face on the bed, a face so strikingly similar to his younger brother's. His father's most beloved youngest son.

His gaze grew colder, finally managing a weak, emotionless smile before turning and leaving.

The moment the ward door closed, Liang Yiming opened his eyes. His usually sharp eyes were unfocused, but the sharp lines in his gaze remained undeniable.

"Have you managed to suppress the news here?"

"Yes, you have," reported General Secretary Wang. There were so many people at the time of the accident that it spread rapidly online. When General Secretary Wang learned of Mr. Liang's accident, he immediately notified the public relations department. "But there were so many press releases, and they spread so quickly… it's like they were prepared."

Whether the accident was truly an "accident" or not, public opinion was definitely deliberate.

"Where is the perpetrator?" he asked, his voice even colder.

"Dead on the spot. The other party is the family member of the person who complained about the new drug last time. The company has given him the report and test results, but he still doesn't believe it. He wants a life for a life."

The driver deliberately hit Mr. Liang, but Mr. Liang's car was specially made, and the driver reacted quickly. Although he was hit, his injuries weren't as severe as the driver who caused the accident. His car collided with Mr. Liang's, and he himself lost control and was thrown from the vehicle, unable to respond to emergency treatment. Now that the other party was dead at the scene, they didn't know how to investigate or hold anyone accountable.

Liang Yiming reached into his pocket to light a cigarette, but only felt the pocket of his hospital gown.

He took a deep breath.

"Arrange for a doctor to come and check on the eyes first," Liang Yiming said, maintaining his gaze straight ahead. "Get our doctor here."

"Okay," Secretary Wang said, making the phone call outside.

If Xia Sang were here, she might recognize this as the hospital where Grandma Xia was staying—a private hospital invested in by Mr. Liang.

The ward door was knocked on again, and this time several doctors in white coats entered. Leading the group was the head of the Liang family's private medical team. "Mr. Liang, please sit in the wheelchair. We'll use the private entrance for a check-up first."

Liang Yiming got up and sat on the edge of the bed. The darkness prevented him from doing anything but clumsily; he could only wait to be led to the wheelchair. Footsteps, the sound of a door opening, the low hum of sophisticated instruments, then a hushed discussion.

"...There's a hematoma shadow near the occipital lobe. We can't rule out the possibility of damage to the optic nerve pathway...compression or direct injury...close observation of the hematoma's absorption is needed...temporarily...blindness..."

The doctors' final conclusion.

"A conservative treatment plan?"

Liang Yiming repeated the doctor's proposed plan. “Yes…Master Liang, the risk of intervention is too high right now. I suggest we observe first,” the person in charge replied.

After a brief silence, Liang Yiming spoke, “I understand. You can make the arrangements.”

“Yes, Master Liang.” They then left the ward.

Only Master Liang and Secretary Wang remained in the ward. Sensing the slightly tense atmosphere, Secretary Wang proactively asked, “Master Liang, do you need me to stay here tonight?”

“…Yes.” Liang Yiming knew he couldn't handle his own life alone right now. He slowly added, “Thank you for your hard work. Is there anything else? We need to get back to the old house as soon as possible.”

The old house also had a medical room where Liang Yiming could continue to recuperate.

"Yes."

After speaking, Liang Yiming paused for a moment before asking, "Have you handled all the work these past two days?"

"No major problems, but there are a few things I might need you to confirm, Mr. Liang."

"Also, have you made any calls other than work calls these past two days?"

"Miss Lin called once; she's rushing back from abroad now," said Secretary Wang.

"Anything else?"

"Not yet."

"Hmm."

A moment later, Secretary Wang went out to prepare dinner, suddenly realizing that Mr. Liang might be asking about Xia Sang.

Night, hospital.

Liang Yiming lay in bed, a familiar, deep-seated hunger beginning to burn in his heart.

He opened his eyes, turned his head to look around, and could feel a slight chill.

An itch.

It rose from his throat.

Liang Yiming wanted a cigarette. He blinked slowly, still unaccustomed to the darkness before him.

A breeze blew from his left, carrying a faint scent of disinfectant and fresh flowers.

Liang Yiming endured it, continuing to rest.

In his half-asleep, half-dreaming state, he saw the old house's room. A little boy sat on the bed. The room was dark, and heavy curtains blocked out all light.

He just watched. The boy's thin face had wide-open eyes.

What did it feel like for a child in such a dark room?

The darkness and fear then were the same as the darkness and pain in the hospital ward now.

No one approached.

No one offered comfort.

A burning thirst coursing through her body, a tug-of-war within her soul.

Hard breathing startled the other person in the room.

A light drizzle tapped against the airport's floor-to-ceiling windows, blurring the distant, flashing neon lights.

Xia Sang hadn't expected the rain to still be falling even after he returned to City B.
