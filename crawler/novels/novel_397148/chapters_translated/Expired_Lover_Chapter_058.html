Chapter 83, Section 57

Liang Yiming sat in his office, listening to the chatter among his subordinates, and couldn't help but think of Xia Sang.

He tapped the table. "Stop talking nonsense. Whoever can do it, get to work."

Although Xia Sang didn't want to come back, there were still many things he didn't understand how to do.

But like Qin Lang had told him when he returned to B City, if he wanted to pursue her, he should take the initiative to bring her back.

If Xia Sang didn't want to come back, then he would go back. Even though he had regained control of the group, he would still make time for her.

Even if he didn't understand, he would keep her by his side.

Thinking this, Liang Yiming waited until he finished his work and drove over in the pouring rain. He didn't see Xia Sang, but instead learned that Xia Sang and Xu Juan had gone up the mountain in the downpour at noon, and that Xia Sang had taken a little girl down the mountain and disappeared. They had even just seen a landslide in the distance.

"What happened?!" Liang Yiming grabbed Chen Anyang's collar and asked. Jin Fulai and Xiao Hong had returned to City B last week; Chen Anyang was the only person Liang Yiming was familiar with here.

“There’s a little girl on the mountain who’s sick. She has a high fever that won’t go down. Only she and her grandfather are at their house, and there’s nobody else around. Xia Sang and Sister Juan went up to give her medicine, but the little girl’s fever didn’t go down; in fact, it got worse… So Xia Sang carried Niu Niu down the mountain.”

To make matters worse, the signal tower on the mountain broke down, and everything started to look increasingly dire.

It should only take about two hours to get down the mountain, but two hours have already passed, and they still haven’t seen Xia Sang.

Everyone is waiting anxiously. Liang Yiming keeps calling Xia Sang, but he can’t get through, over and over again.

He couldn't remember how many times he'd asked Secretary Wang, "How much longer until the rescue team arrives?"

"The rain is too heavy. The helicopters can't come. We'll have to wait for a vehicle. It'll take about two or three hours."

Liang Yiming looked out at the torrential rain. He thought of Xia Sang in the mountains. Was this another test for him?

He looked at the winding mountain road. His eyesight was better now. He had everything he had before. He had come back to chase after Xia Sang, and this was what happened.

Liang Yiming's face grew increasingly cold. He asked himself, should he go up the mountain?

The rain outside intensified, blurring all visibility. Night shrouded the distant mountains.

Going up the mountain was dangerous.

So no one dared to go.

Before nature, no matter his wealth, knowledge, or looks, he would be destroyed like an ant.

Even his lack of expertise.

His contribution would be negligible.

Liang Yiming knew this.

But what if Xia Sang didn't come down?

This thought suddenly popped into his mind. If something really happened to Xia Sang, what would he do…?

He said he would chase after her. What if Xia Sang was gone?

Chase after what? A tombstone?

Liang Yiming scoffed.

He should wait here. If Xia Sang was in danger, going up now would be futile, and might even cost him his life. But if Xia Sang truly died, he would never see her again…

The rain pattered against the treetops, the ground, and his heart. Liang Yiming grabbed his raincoat, the emergency lamp from the table, and some other necessities.

He had to go up the mountain.

If he didn't go this time, he would regret it.

Not right or wrong, not the odds of winning, not the stakes, but the regret.

Regret seemed impossible to calculate with reason or weighing.

He had given up their last meeting; he would regret it.

In that instant, Liang Yiming stood resolutely before the rain. He knew he had to go.

Wang, the general secretary, tried to dissuade Liang from going up the mountain. "Mr. Liang, it's too dangerous to go up now in this weather. Let's wait for the rescue team."

Liang Yiming shook his head. "If they encounter problems halfway up the mountain, every second will be dangerous."

"If I can find them, perhaps I'll have a better chance of survival."

Wang glanced at Liang Yiming, gritted his teeth, and said, "I'll go up with you."

"No need," Liang Yiming refused Wang's offer; it was his personal choice. "You can make arrangements once the rescue team arrives. You have to stay here."

"I'll go with you too," Chen Anyang said. “It’s safer with another person. They’re still up there, I’ll go with you.”

Everyone looked at Chen Anyang, but his mother immediately blocked his way. “You can’t go. Nobody knows what’s going on. The rescue team will be here in two or three hours. You don’t know anything, what if you rush up the mountain and it’s dangerous!”

“Mom!”

“What will I do if something happens to you?” Chen’s mother gripped Chen Anyang’s hand. “You’re my only son.”

Chen Anyang looked troubled. “Mom, don’t be like this.”

The two argued on and on, but Liang Yiming didn’t say anything. He put on his raincoat and strode into the rainy night.

Chen Anyang wanted to leave but his mother held him back, leaving him no choice but to watch Liang Yiming depart.

His hands clenched into fists, his heart filled with torment.

Liang Yiming continued walking along the mountain path, the rain lashing against his raincoat with a deafening noise, intensifying his agitation.

Further ahead, he would reach the landslide area. Liang Yiming could only hope that Xia Sang wasn't blocking the other side.

As he continued walking, he saw a little girl lying on the ground. He rushed over and touched her warm body. This must be Niu Niu they had mentioned. What was Niu Niu doing here?

Where was Xia Sang?

Xia Sang and the others couldn't have let Niu Niu go down the mountain alone.

Liang Yiming shouted anxiously, "Xia Sang!"

"I'm here!"

Suddenly, a shout came from the slope beside the road. Liang Yiming looked over and saw Xia Sang!

Xia Sang was hanging at the bottom of a slope, clinging to a dead tree and vines. Muddy water flowed around him, making it impossible for him to climb up!

"Grandpa Liang, pull me up!" Xia Sang cried.

Liang Yiming reached out, but the rain on his leather gloves made them slippery. He tried several times but couldn't grab Xia Sang.

Staring at the gloves in his hands, in a flash, he took them off and threw them aside.

The rain stung his skin; it hurt so much.

He grabbed Xia Sang's hand; the pain was like needles pricking him, and an itch coursed through his body. He pulled her up with all his might, the rain pouring down. Every second counted, and he finally managed to pull her up. Xia Sang followed, a heavy breath pressing on his chest, his eyes bulging with tears.

She's rescued.

She's alright.

The same goes for Xia Sang.

She's alive.

She's alright.

Xia Sang gasped for breath, his face pale, his legs trembling and weak. He covered his face with his hands, unsure whether the water in his palms was rain, sweat, or tears…

“It doesn’t hurt anymore, it doesn’t hurt anymore.” Liang Yiming’s cool hand touched Xia Sang’s face. Xia Sang’s face had several scratches, and he didn’t realize how pitiful his expression was. His puppy-like eyes were wet and bright, like tiny, glistening flowers.

The warmth of the touch, this time, didn’t travel through Liang Yiming’s weathered hands to reach him clearly.

Liang Yiming looked at Xia Sang and repeated, "It doesn't hurt."

He held Xia Sang tightly in his arms, burying his face in her neck for a few seconds before standing up.

"Do you still have the strength?" Liang Yiming asked Xia Sang.

Xia Sang nodded. He lifted her up, supporting her, and walked to the little girl, then picked her up as well.

With Xia Sang, the feeling wasn't as pronounced. Touching Niu Niu still made Liang Yiming somewhat resistant, but this time the feeling was much weaker than before, and the feeling that disgusted him was like being gently lifted by something. Although it hadn't completely disappeared, it no longer bothered him.

He looked down at Xia Sang, who was struggling to support herself.

Perhaps Xia Sang was his star,

like the brightest star in summer. He wasn't the most dazzling star in the crowd, but he was the one he needed most.

The rain soaked Liang Yiming's carefully combed hair, making him look quite disheveled, but the way he supported Xia Sang with one hand and held Niu Niu in the other was a sight that Secretary Wang, who had gone up the mountain with the rescue team, would probably never forget.

…
Xia Sang fainted halfway up the mountain. When she woke up, she saw Liang Yiming sitting beside her.

“Do you know how dangerous this is?” Liang Yiming couldn't suppress the lingering fear and anger. How could someone be so foolish as to risk their life to save…one…

Liang Yiming didn't know how to describe it—an unworthy person, a child from the mountains.

Ordinary, poor, the kind of person you see everywhere.

Not worth it…

The wind from the window ruffled Xia Sang's slightly disheveled black hair. Looking at Xia Sang's dejected expression, Liang Yiming couldn't bring himself to say anything more.

How could he blame Xia Sang? How could he bear to blame her?

Liang Yiming covered his mouth with his hand, his eyes fixed on her.

Xia Sang was so brave, that's why she understood him, and even after what she had gone through, she was still willing to love him.

He rushed forward and hugged Xia Sang tightly, his moist eyes pressed against her neck, his hot breath burning against her skin. "I'm proud of you."

Liang Yiming kissed Xia Sang's earlobe.

"I love you."

"Xia Sang, please give me another chance," Liang Yiming said solemnly.

"Okay," Xia Sang said hesitantly, her eyes misty, "but Mr. Liang, your pressure hurts my hand a little."

"Hahaha." "Hahahaha." The people around couldn't help but laugh.

1. Some unresolved subplots

2. The specific plot of how Grandpa Liang pursues Xiaxia afterward

3. Grandpa Liang's "henpecked" daily life

4. A "what if" scenario suggested by friends and family, where Grandpa Liang and Xiaxia met as children~
