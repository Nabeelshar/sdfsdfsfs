Chapter 38 19 Snakes

Xia Sang rushed to the production crew's RV, carrying Xingxing. "Quick, where's the medical staff?"

The medical staff was pulled out of the vehicle. Seeing Xingxing's swollen leg, he was instantly jolted awake. "This is poisonous! What do we do!"

"Aren't you a doctor?" The director, who had followed, was also anxious. "You're asking me what to do?"

"No, I can only treat it briefly. We need to get to the hospital as soon as possible."

"Has anyone seen what kind of snake it is?"

"I didn't see it clearly, but it was green," Xia Sang said.

"That might be a bamboo viper. It won't be fatal immediately. Get her to the hospital quickly!"

The director jumped up and shouted to the others, "Quick, quick, get her to the hospital!"

"And someone else, call the hospital immediately to explain the situation!" Everyone sprang into action.

At this moment, the still-on live stream chat erupted in chaos.

Chat comments:

1st floor: Oh my god, no way, something's happened!

2nd floor: Oh my god. Bitten by a snake!!

3rd floor: This is a major accident!!

Just as the doctor was cleaning Xingxing's wound and forcibly putting a splint on her...

Xingxing suddenly convulsed and began breathing rapidly. The doctor, seeing this, nearly went berserk. "Damn it, I'm so unlucky! His symptoms might be anaphylactic shock, very dangerous. He's so young, holy crap!"

"What are you talking about?" Xia Sang frowned. "Aren't you a doctor?"

"Yes, but I'm filling in today. His condition is too dangerous; he could suffocate and die at any moment." The man scratched his head. If anything happened to this child, he wouldn't be able to escape responsibility.

"Then what do we do now?!" Xia Sang was furious at the doctor's attitude.

"I...I've already cleaned the wound and forced it in," the man said nervously. "I...I'll call my mentor, please wait a moment."

"The hospital has already sent an ambulance," the director said, sweating profusely. "We'll head over right away and get Xingxing detoxified en route."

As he spoke, Xia Sang carried Xingxing into the director's car. A staff member nearby asked the director, "Director, the company's back-end phones are ringing off the hook. Should we shut down the live stream?"

Shut it down, or not?

Shut it down? If something goes wrong during the process, they won't be able to explain themselves.

Don't shut it down? This will be a huge mess!

The director was so worried his hair was practically greasy. Just then, Xingxing twitched a few more times, her face turning even paler.

Xia Sang stared, feeling as if he shared the same emotions as the stars; he couldn't breathe either.

In an instant, he suddenly remembered he knew where the latest serum was.

It was at Master Liang's villa, in that silver box.

Xia Sang bit his lower lip nervously, his head throbbing with a jumble of thoughts.

Could this be Liang Yize's doing? Has he gone mad?

Impossible. He cares about Master Liang so much; he wouldn't kill someone.

An accident? How could such an accident happen? What should I do?

Take the crew to Master Liang's villa?

Xia Sang looked around; the director, the production crew, the cameramen, the videographers—all the figures were crammed into a blurry, chilling image.

He'll be exposed, exposed for being a kept man.

What will he face?

What will Master Liang think of him?

How will the company handle this?

...
Too many questions, Xia Sang couldn't think them through, couldn't understand them.

His brain had lost the ability to think.

He heard his own trembling lips and chattering teeth, the painful, dry, tearing sound coming from his throat—"You come with me."

"What did you say?" the director asked in surprise.

"I know where the serum should be." Xia Sang's voice became a little clearer.

"Should be? Xia Sang, if your personal actions cause injury to a guest, our production team will not be responsible!" The director thought Xia Sang had gone mad, getting himself into trouble.

Xingxing started gagging, breathing heavily, looking absolutely terrible.

"Bullshit! He won't last long in this condition," the accompanying doctor yelled. "Do you even know where he is? No matter what, we have to go try."

The director was speechless, his face turning ashen. He called for a car, and Xia Sang immediately carried Xingxing and the doctor into the director's car, giving them directions and the address. Following Xia Sang's instructions, the driver drove towards the center of the villa district.

Xia Sang looked up at the dark camera lens, unable to imagine the expression on the person behind it. "Could you please stop filming?" he asked.

The director looked at him and laughed, "How could we not film? Who knows what might happen if we don't?"

Xia Sang held Xingxing's hand, watching the familiar house draw closer, the spacious and comfortable garden, and in the distance, he could see Robles' doghouse. Because of what happened last time, Robles had been sent to Liang Ye's large apartment in the city a few days ago.

Now, only the butler and nanny were in the villa. Xia Sang could only console himself that the only good thing was that they wouldn't film any more people.

Xia Sang lowered his head, looking at Xingxing nestled in his arms, and told himself that nothing was more precious than life.

Nothing.

Comments:

1st Floor: Where is Xia Sang going? Shouldn't he be heading straight down the mountain? Why is he going into the villa area?

2nd Floor: The production team should be the most responsible. Aren't they responsible for the guests' safety?

3rd Floor: This is too exciting!

Reaching a villa, Xia Sang stopped, pressed the electronic keypad key, and quickly led everyone inside.

The car stopped on the driveway in the middle of the garden. The housekeeper came out and saw a group of people and Xia Sang. Coincidentally, it was the same maid who had walked the dog last time.

"Please keep an eye on things," Xia Sang said, handing Xingxing to the doctor before entering the villa. The remaining people in the garden were buzzing with discussion, speculating about what was happening. Some had already secretly taken out their phones to record the conversation.

Xia Sang ran frantically to the gate. "Don't let them into the villa," she told the maid, who nodded.

This was Master Liang's villa. It was already excessive for him to bring people; even his familiar butler and servants didn't like to linger in the villa. Xia Sang couldn't possibly let them in.

Xia Sang rushed into the study to find the box he remembered. He recalled seeing Master Liang place it at the bottom of a drawer in the desk.

Following his memory, he opened the drawer and easily retrieved the silver box.

Just then, his phone rang.

Xia Sang stared at his phone screen—[Grandpa Liang].

Xia Sang's heart skipped a beat, pounding wildly. What was Grandpa Liang calling for at this hour? To scold? Or to interrogate?

Xia Sang felt a sudden tightness in his chest. He hung up and rushed downstairs with determined steps.

Xia Sang ran incredibly fast, feeling as if he were flying.

Once outside, he rushed out and handed the box to the accompanying doctor.

The doctor nervously opened it, checked it, and thankfully, it did contain the serum for bamboo viper!

He immediately injected Xingxing with it.

After the injection, Xingxing's convulsions began to subside, the pain on her face eased, and her breathing became smoother.

Xia Sang breathed a sigh of relief, and tears silently streamed down her face without her realizing it.

That's great, that's great.
