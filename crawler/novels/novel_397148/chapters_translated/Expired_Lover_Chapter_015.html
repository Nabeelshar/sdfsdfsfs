Chapter 34 15 Variety Shows (Part 4)

It was almost noon when Huo Ran and Cong Hongfei returned, both looking exhausted.

When the group approached, they discovered that not only was their money gone, but they hadn't bought everything they needed, and even less than they had expected.

Upon asking, they learned that the place was close to the villa area, where prices were high. Neither of them knew much about prices; their phone searches were hazy, yielding all sorts of prices, and they were too shy to haggle.

Cong Hongfei felt that as a celebrity, he was easily embarrassed, while Huo Ran was completely clueless about how to ask questions. If he did, he wouldn't have been attacked so badly.

The group sighed in resignation, consoling each other, "At least the production crew won't let us starve."

At noon, they drew lots to determine who would cook. After lunch and a short rest, the production crew announced the afternoon's location—a children's amusement park.

Everyone else was ready to get into the car in the villa's small garden, except for Xia Sang, who stood at the gate to see them off.

Because his punishment from yesterday hadn't been completed, the director had assigned him to stay at the villa that afternoon to clean.

"Isn't Brother Xia Sang going?" Xingxing looked at Xia Sang, her eyes overflowing with longing.

"Brother, let's make the house clean and pretty today." Xia Sang patted Xingxing's head. "Xingxing, have fun when you go out."

"Then Xingxing will stay with brother at work and won't go to the amusement park."

"Thank you, Xingxing, but the director said you have to come play games with him."

The production team had arranged activities for several children that afternoon, and Xingxing couldn't be left out. Besides, Xia Sang remembered how Xingxing's eyes lit up when she heard about going to the amusement park.

Xiao Lin, who was standing nearby, chimed in, "Don't worry, I'll take good care of Xingxing."

Without Xia Sang as her intern father, Xiao Lin offered to look after Xingxing for Xia Sang.

The live chat was filled with praise for Xiao Lin, and Xia Sangye was deeply moved. She hadn't expected Xiao Lin to be so kind and approachable. Thinking about it, besides being a good person, it was probably because they were both at the bottom of the popularity rankings here, and they felt a sense of shared misfortune.

"Xingxing, stay close to Brother Xiao Lin and have fun," Xia Sangye said, handing Xingxing's hand to Xiao Lin. "Brother will be home, waiting for you to come back."

Xingxing took Xiao Lin's hand and got into the car.

After getting in the car, he kept looking at Xia Sangye through the window until her brother's figure grew further and further away. He then sniffled sadly.

"Xingxing, don't be sad," Xiao Lin patted Xingxing's back. "It's okay with your brother here."

Xingxing didn't answer, but murmured, "I'm going to help Xia Sang get first place at the event later! That way, he won't have to stay home alone."

Xiao Lin paused, then smiled slightly. "Then Xingxing, do your best!"

Xia Sang watched as the director and main camera crew left with the group of celebrities.

Only he and his cameraman remained.

He looked back at the enormous villa…

It was a truly unsightly scene.

Xia Sang first led the cameraman around, showing him around the villa. The live-stream cameraman walked along, his camera pointed at him.

Finally, Xia Sang looked at the live-stream camera and hesitated.

What should he say next?

Xia Sang held up the cleaning list provided by the production team to the camera and spoke to the cameraman, "Do you think anyone would want to see me cleaning?"

The cameraman shook his head without answering; his work contract stipulated that cameramen couldn't speak.

Xia Sang, on the other hand, couldn't use her phone to watch the live stream.

"You can't speak, so can you watch the live stream?"

"I heard your bonuses are also related to cameraman data, isn't that terrible?"

"I heard my salary is the lowest among celebrities, is yours too?"

Cameraman: …………

Unable to speak, Xia Sang could only chat with him alone while cleaning, at least to keep the live stream from getting awkward.

"I'm pretty good at housework, and I cook really well."

"I even used to be an extra in a servant's video game."

"And I've also filmed the butler's."

"And the henchman's."

Xia Sang suddenly looked up. Since they've gone this far, why not...?!

Xia Sang quickly texted Brother Jin.

At that moment, Brother Jin was watching Xia Sang's live stream at the company.

Especially seeing that Xia Sang, who usually had the lowest viewership this afternoon, was missing the group's variety show live stream and her online viewership was steadily declining, his anger surged. "Damn it, how are we supposed to play this game?!"

"Didn't you say Master Liang was a good guy? Why aren't you speaking up for him this time?" Jin Fulai scolded.

"It's not Master Liang's fault..." Xiao Hong.

"You're right, those damn rich people!"

Jin Ge was completely deaf to everyone else.

Xiao Hong was helpless.

Just then, Jin Ge received a message from Xia Sang. He darted back to his desk, pulled open the previously criticized "Internet Celebrity Handbook" from the drawer.

His eyes lit up. "Quick, Xiao Hong, let's send Xia Sang a gift!"

After Xia Sang finished cleaning up, the livestream's viewership dropped even further.

But he took a deep breath and said to the cameraman, "Although I can't watch the livestream, I didn't say I can't do anything funny, right?"

The cameraman looked puzzled. From the moment he was alone, he had no idea what this celebrity was up to.

The doorbell rang.

The cameraman followed Xia Sang to the villa's gate. No one was in the frame, except for a fleeting glimpse of a plump figure off-camera.

What was in the frame was a large package.

Xia Sang smiled and picked up the package.

"These are some clothes my agent prepared for me. For the director's ratings, and to keep everyone entertained, we prepared some props and costumes to make the live stream more interesting."

She excitedly carried the package into the bathroom.

Comments:

1st Floor: What's going on?

2nd Floor: This is so boring…

Soon, the bathroom door opened.

Xia Sang, wearing a monocle and a black butler's suit, stepped out and bowed to the camera—"Hello, my dear young master and young lady."

At this moment, Xia Sang's handsome and dashing appearance became apparent.

In the camera's view, he gazed affectionately at "you," becoming "your" one and only butler.

Comments:

1st Floor: Holy crap, is this even possible??

2nd Floor: Exit and re-enter, re-enter and exit, making sure I didn't enter the wrong livestream room.

3rd Floor: I'm starting to understand Xia Sang.

4th Floor: Doesn't it feel awkward...?

5th Floor: If you're awkward, then leave!

[The first requirement for performance: Have full conviction, forget yourself, forget the props, become the character in this moment.]

Not only that, Xia Sang would also add her own dramatic flair, wiping tables in a butler's uniform, frequently uttering memorable butler lines:

"It's been so long since I've seen the young master smile like that, the glass is even more reflective now."

"You're the first one the young master has taken a fancy to—a ceramic mug."

And every half hour, Xia Sang would change her clothes to keep things fresh.

In the bathroom, Xia Sang was surprised to find... a maid's apron in her bag.

Xiao Hong, you're really something...

Thinking this, Xia Sang decisively took off her suit jacket and put the apron on.

Her straight legs were clad in black dress pants, and she wore a white shirt. The simple apron prevented Xia Sang from actually wearing women's clothing, yet her allure was undeniable, creating a dramatic effect.

When Xia Sang opened the door, Jin Ge, sitting in a car outside the villa, was dumbfounded. This was a bit of a challenge to his aesthetic sense. "Xiao Hong, you're too bold!"

"What do you know!" Xiao Hong exclaimed excitedly. "Variety shows are all about buzz! It's all about contrast!"

Xiao Hong held up her phone, live-streaming, "Look! It's gone viral!"

Comments:

1st Floor: She really has a maid outfit!

2nd Floor: Brave, so brave, hahaha!

3rd Floor: Small workshops really go all out!!

4th Floor: Besides you, who else spoils me like this!!

In an instant, the live stream viewership skyrocketed, surpassing Xia Sang's viewership from the previous day.

Because the world is never short of entertainers.

Following this, starting with the maid apron, Xiao Hong prepared a series of classic fairytale outfits for Xia Sang, all embodying the theme of "working."

A simplified version of Cinderella's apron, Snow White… the variety was endless!

Xia Sang even acted out several classic fairytale scenes.

Not only that, she also incorporated lines from various corny extras' performances, such as Cinderella's rebirth, the satisfying revenge against her stepmother, and Snow White's cunning and ruthless queen.

Familiar characters, melodramatic modern plots, and the contrast immediately led to screenshots of the live stream being shared widely.

The live stream data exploded.

Even the photographer couldn't help but secretly give him a thumbs up at the end.

—No need to be at the bottom of this week's bonus /thumbs up.jpg

Liang Yize had been in meetings all day, and by the time he heard the news, Xia Sang's live stream was almost over.

He opened the video, looked at the barrage of comments, and gritted his teeth.

"He's shameless, willing to do something like this, immediately stop him..." and Xia Sang will have to accept new punishment.

He was about to give the order, but looking at the soaring data and remembering his brother's questioning, he could only hold back. "A new rule regarding this must be added next time."

The assistant nodded repeatedly, then brought up another piece of news, "Your father has returned to the country."

Liang Yize scoffed, "What happened?"

"I heard his business failed."

Liang Yize gave a mocking smile, "He has plenty of children to take care of him; it's not my turn."

"Miss Lin has also returned to the country," the assistant continued.

"What? Aunt Lin is back?" Liang Yize exclaimed in surprise.

"Yes, the specific itinerary hasn't been finalized yet. I guess we'll go back to the old house to rest first."

Liang Yize's mood immediately improved. "I understand. I'll visit Aunt Lin."

After finishing cleaning, Xia Sang continued her activities until the camera crew reminded her that the production team was returning. She quickly changed back into her clothes.

Soon after, the car arrived. Xia Sang rushed to the door to greet Xingxing, only to find that Xingxing's eyes were red.

"What's wrong!" Xia Sang hugged Xingxing tenderly.

Xingxing, who had been holding back tears the whole way, finally let them flow.

"Brother Xia Sang, we fell."

"We're still in last place."

Xingxing sobbed uncontrollably, her pitiful little face breaking Xia Sang's heart.

In the afternoon, they arrived at the amusement park. First, parents took their children to play, and then they played a three-legged race on the grass. The winner of the second round of the activity's starting bonus will receive the most, distributed according to ranking.

The first few groups of children were fine, but in Xingxing's group, Xiao Lin seemed too anxious and fell halfway through, causing Xingxing to stumble as well. Luckily, Xiao Lin caught him, preventing any injuries, but they still came in last place.

"It's okay."

"We don't need to be first."

"But only the first-place winner can go out to play with their brother."

"I'm last, boohoo."

Xia Sang patted his head, her heart softening.

Xiao Lin also stepped forward, "I'm sorry, Xingxing kept saying he wanted you to get first place, maybe I was too impatient."

Xia Sang didn't want to blame Xiao Lin; after all, it was just an accident.

"It's alright, Teacher Xiao Lin. Did you hurt yourself anywhere?"

"No, no."

That night, after everyone had dinner, Xiao Lin went to his room to help Zhuang Zhuang wash up and prepare for bed.

Just as he lay down, he heard a knock at the door. He opened it and found Xia Sang.

She was holding a tube of ointment, explaining that she was worried about him because he hadn't asked the production team for any, so she gave him one.

Xiao Lin listened to his own soft, stiff voice, put on a standard smile, thanked her, said goodbye, and closed the door.

Then he threw the ointment into the trash can, disgusted by Xia Sang's well-intentioned but ultimately insipid kindness.

Xiao Lin sat back on the bed, looking at his slightly scraped knee, recalling how he had deliberately fallen that afternoon to delay Xingxing's work. How could he let Xia Sang get first place? They were the same kind of people, yet Xia Sang was so lucky. Xia Sang had put in so much effort; Xia Sang deserved to succeed.

In the darkness, Xiao Lin's phone beeped.

He received a new message: "[You stole the show today, watch out.]"

Xiao Lin angrily threw his phone on the bed. Another message arrived: "[When will the 5 million arrive?]"

Xiao Lin glanced at it, his fists clenched, his teeth grinding. These people wouldn't let him go, they wouldn't let him go!

With nowhere to vent his rage, Xiao Lin finally couldn't help but hide in the bathroom and slap himself hard.
