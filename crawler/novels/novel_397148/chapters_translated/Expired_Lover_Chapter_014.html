<h1>Chapter 33, 14 Variations (Part 3)</h1>

Chapter 33 14 tricks (3)

Liang Yiming picked up his cell phone and called. After a long beep, he remembered that he was participating in a variety show.

He contacted General Secretary Wang and opened the link sent over.

At the beginning of the video, he couldn't help but laugh when he saw Xia Sang's unlucky appearance.

Then, when he saw Xia Sang riding a bicycle to the suburbs with sweat all over his face, panting heavily but trying to hold on to his energy, he lowered his eyebrows and frowned.

Later, Xia Sang took the children back and walked back and forth. The words in the barrage became more and more unpleasant, and the two groups of people were quarreling. His muscles were tense and the lines on his body turned into straight lines.

Liang Yiming paused the video and called Liang Yize. “Hey, bro.” The voice on Liang Yize's end was a bit noisy.

“Where are you?”

“Out having fun.”

“Today’s the first day of the variety show’s premiere, aren’t you keeping an eye on it?”

“All the pre-production work is done. The director has directed many variety shows, and my assistant is with him.”

“Is it okay for a celebrity to ride a bike for four hours round trip to pick up guests?”

There was silence on the other end of the phone. Liang Yiming asked again, “Was the script confirmed with the celebrity beforehand?”

“…No.”

“Then the probability of random combinations in the pre-production work…nobody’s going to comment.” "Estimated?"

Liang Yiming's deep voice brushed against Liang Yize's ears. Liang Yize immediately had the sound system turned off, put down his wine glass, and asked, "Brother, is it because of Xia Sang?"

"Whoever it is, since you requested this variety show job, you should handle it properly," Liang Yiming said. "Such an inappropriate arrangement, and after two hours, no one has raised any objections or proposed improvements. Is it their problem, or yours?"

"Brother, I wasn't targeting Xia Sang," Liang Yize tried to explain.

But hearing this, Liang Yiming felt a splitting headache and didn't want to say anything more. "Go to the work site immediately and oversee the project."

The call ended.

Liang Yize smashed his wine glass on the ground.

Damn it, it's that Xia Sang again.

Liang Yiming continued playing the video, lit a cigarette, and by the time the video finished playing on fast forward, it was past midnight.

His past lovers always liked to turn to him for help with whatever happened.

He hated that.

Alone.

Xia Sang used to like texting him too, but the difference was that he texted about trivial things—a cat, a cloud—anything could become a topic of conversation.

He would sometimes reply, sometimes not.

Xia Sang still enjoyed it.

Until the gift incident, Xia Sang rarely texted him unless absolutely necessary.

He suddenly wondered if Xia Sang would only speak up if something as dire as what happened to Grandma Xia.

For example, he had felt the slightest dissatisfaction with Xia Sang's change in attitude, a dissatisfaction that even carried over to their bedroom, especially when his sexual desire was at its peak.

He clung to Xia Sang relentlessly; he both hated and loved her.

He heard Xia Sang call out to him, "Master Liang, be gentle, be gentle."

He said, "Beg me."

Xia Sang gripped his arm, silent, her watery eyes fixed on him.

He refused to yield.

But sometimes he would yield and comply.

It was as if the thread of their relationship was in Xia Sang's hands.

Liang Yiming lit another cigarette.

The next morning, at the crack of dawn.

Xia Sang, his head buried in the pillow, curled up in his sleep, heard some clattering sounds.

He turned over, and Xia Sang felt pain all over his body, especially his legs, which felt like they were useless.

Xia Sang sat up and cried out, "Ouch—it hurts so much!"

He felt like he was turning into a Transformer; his whole body felt like it could reassemble itself at any moment.

When he opened his eyes again and saw the unfamiliar room, he remembered that he was participating in a variety show.

He quickly looked for Xingxing and saw him curled up against the wall, sleeping soundly, and his heart relaxed.

He looked up at the time; it was only 7 o'clock. The live broadcast didn't start until 8 o'clock. Who was up so early?

Just then, a loud bang came from outside the room. Xia Sang quickly looked at Xingxing and saw him rubbing his eyes, awake. She called to him softly.

"Brother Xia Sang, I need to pee." Xingxing sat up, curled himself into a ball, and tried to get off the bed by turning his back to the foot of the bed. Xia Sang quickly helped him.

"Don't worry, I'll take you." Xia Sang picked up Xingxing, looking at his rosy, fair face from sleeping, and couldn't help but kiss him.

After taking care of Xingxing's needs, she brushed his teeth and washed his face, and finally changed him into a light yellow shirt with white cuffs and brown pants.

Xingxing was four years old this year, small in stature, with dark, bright eyes, curled eyelashes, and rosy lips. His hands were behind his back, and he curiously looked around.

He was so adorable.

Xia Sang was instantly captivated, acting like a doting parent. "Xingxing, what do you want to see?"

Xingxing looked at her brother Xia Sang shyly and shook her head. "Grandma Director said that when you come to the show, you have to work hard and not be naughty."

"Xingxing, do you know what work is?" Xia Sang hugged Xingxing tightly.

Xingxing tilted her head and counted on her fingers, “Do your own thing, wash your hands before eating, don’t be picky about food… and listen to Brother Xiasang and the other uncles.”

After counting, Xingxing looked up and asked, “Is what Xingxing said right?”

“Yes, did Grandma the director tell you that?”

“Yes, Grandma the director said I’m a little kid, and little kids just need to do this job.”

Xiasang asked curiously, “Does Xingxing know she’s here to work?”

Xingxing raised her hand and said loudly, “Xingxing knows! Auntie takes pictures of Xingxing, and lots of people like them, so the uncles hire Xingxing for work, and there’s lots and lots of money! We can repaint the house, paint, there’s a little swing, and chicken legs!”

Xingxing became more and more excited as she spoke, her soft little hands waving in the air, “Xingxing likes working!”

Her words made Xiasang laugh.

Xia Sang led Xingxing out the door and saw staff members walking around—the noise earlier was from a staff member dropping a prop.

The first floor, being the main activity area, was bound to be a bit noisy, so Xia Sang took Xingxing back to her room to prevent staff from accidentally bumping into her.

Xia Sang and Xingxing played on the bed for a while when the live stream camera in the room beeped twice, started flashing, and started playing instrumental music.

"Dear intern dads and babies, a new day has begun! Please come downstairs for breakfast!"

It's the weekend today. Yesterday's live stream audience was mostly fans, and last night's test broadcast helped build up the buzz.

More and more netizens started tuned in to the live stream, eagerly flooding the chat with comments:

1st Floor: Nothing's more fun than watching a live stream on the weekend.

2nd Floor: Quick, let me see if Xiao Ran is taking good care of my Rou Rou Princess.

3rd Floor: Working people come to cuddle with the kids this weekend.

4th Floor: Time to go to work! Dads! Time to go to work!

The announcement was repeated three times.

The whole little house started to wake up.

First, Huo Ran and Le Mingzhi came downstairs at the same time, then Xiao Lin, and finally Cong Hongfei, who looked the sleepiest of them all.

Tao Tao, whom he was holding, wiggled around like a little monkey, his eyes sparkling. "Brother, brother, hurry up, hurry up!"

Cong Hongfei was so exhausted he wanted to bang his head on the ground. He didn't know why Tao Tao woke up in the middle of the night last night. Not only did he wake up, but he was also woken up to play with him, and his toys were confiscated. Tao Tao kept crying for his toys, and he had to patiently soothe him all night.

After everyone arrived, the host stood on the table. Besides breakfast, there was a lottery box.

The host smiled and said, "Before breakfast, please draw lots to be the first purchasing agent, and remember to bring your little one along."

Several intern fathers stepped forward to draw lots. Some were indifferent to being drawn, while others didn't want to be. Clearly, Huo Ran was the least interested; he stared at the lottery box as if he wanted to blow it up.

Comments:

1st Floor: I saw murderous intent in Ran-ge's expression.

2nd Floor: Ran-ge must want to beat up the host Zou right now, hahaha.

3rd Floor: He can't be that unlucky, hahaha.

Several people simultaneously opened their slips of paper; the winners were Huo Ran and Cong Hongfei.

Huo Ran's expression was cold, but with a hint of a crack.

Le Mingzhi laughed heartily beside him; he always found something to enjoy in these kinds of segments.

There was no way around it; Huo Ran was truly unlucky in a certain sense. Aside from being born into a bad family, he had never won a lottery in his life.

Whenever he had something he didn't want to do, he would draw lots with Huo Ran, and it always worked.

Not only that, but he's also constantly trending on social media for negative reasons, and he's not well-liked, always running into bad people.

Huo Ran stared blankly at the camera. "You don't always assign tasks by drawing lots, do you?"

Comments:

1st Floor: Hahahaha

2nd Floor: I think the director is sweating bullets. Lock the door tight tonight.

3rd Floor: No wonder Brother Ran always lets Lele draw the prizes on shows; he's just unlucky.

"No, next time the remaining people will draw. Everyone will take turns completing the tasks, everyone gets a share." The directing team emphasized the last few words.

"Hahaha." Everyone laughed out loud.

But when they sat down to eat breakfast and discuss the shopping, the laughter stopped.

Huo Ran and Cong Hongfei needed to buy three days' worth of food. After inquiring, they discovered neither had any experience.

"I'm an only child; my mother never let me do anything," Cong Hongfei said.

Two young masters with no practical experience going shopping alone—the rest of the group could only think one thing: disaster.

"None of you have ever been to a market to buy groceries?"

"I've been to a supermarket," Cong Hongfei immediately replied.

"..." Huo Ran.

Furthermore, most of the villas halfway up the mountain now rely on groceries delivered, so if they wanted to buy anything, they would need to use the small tricycle provided by the production team to find the nearest market.

"Hahahaha," Le Mingzhi laughed heartlessly from the side, "It's a miracle these two even came back alive."

"..." Xia Sang Xiaolin. Even the children seemed to sense the seriousness of the situation, quietly watching their older brothers.

In the end, the only way to control costs was to plan the menu and quantities in advance and limit purchases.

After breakfast, Huo Ran and Cong Hongfei took the children out. Xia Sang originally planned to finish the cleaning first, but Zhuangzhuang kept pulling on Dou Dou's braids, and the two children ran around and made a racket, with no end in sight. Dou Dou started crying for her mother.

After the three of them spent a long time trying to calm them down, they finally gathered them in the living room to watch cartoons. The atmosphere was just right, and Xia Sang wanted to leave, but she noticed that Xingxing was still holding onto her clothes even while watching cartoons, so she silently sat back down.

Although they are usually quiet and well-behaved, they are still afraid when they come to new places.
