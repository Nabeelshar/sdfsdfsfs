Chapter 61 41 Has She Come or Not (Revised)

Liang Yiming knew exactly what his aunt was up to.

“It’s nighttime, let Miss Feng go home,” he said.

Immediately, a tugging sound came from behind him. Liang Yiming couldn’t see the two people, but he listened patiently and waited patiently.

The darkness constantly reminded him that he was at a disadvantage, so he couldn’t be impatient.

“Miss Feng heard you were sick and came immediately.” He heard Lin Leman lean slightly down and speak softly in his ear, seemingly out of concern. “Your eyes are injured and you can’t see, so you need someone to keep you company. Why don’t you let Miss Feng keep you company?”

“Miss Feng, a young woman, is it alright for Uncle Feng to leave her here alone?” Liang Yiming retorted, followed by a louder tugging sound. Liang Yiming interrupted Lin Leman, saying, “Miss Feng and I have no relationship, so we should be discreet. Manager Wang, please contact Manager Feng and have him send a car to pick Miss Feng up.”

“No!” Miss Feng quickly stopped him. She didn’t know what her father meant, and if he found out she didn’t agree, she would be scolded to death. “I’ll make the arrangements myself. Aunt Lin… Yi… Yiming, I’ll be going now.” With that, her face flushed, she ran away in her little leather shoes.

Watching Miss Feng's departing figure, Lin Leman was incredibly pleased with her. Young, well-behaved, innocent, from a good family, and willing to take care of others.

"Yiming, I think..."

"I don't need your opinion..." Liang Yiming, dressed in a white shirt and casual pants, his usual style slightly disheveled due to his illness, his normally clean and soft attire now appearing somewhat gloomy under the dim light of the old European-style house, his lowered brows revealing a hint of melancholy. "...I think you're being too controlling."

"I...I'm worried that if you're sick, no one will take care of you," Lin Leman said.

Liang Yiming scoffed, "Auntie, that'll do you a good job of fooling Miss Feng."

Lin Leman's face turned ashen. She wanted to retort but dared not speak because of Liang Yiming.

If she didn't seize this opportunity, would Liang Yiming listen to her? "I'm doing this for his own good," Lin Leman kept telling herself, but when she heard Liang Yiming say, "If Auntie has such thoughts, why don't you take my seat? No, don't be so opinionated," her anger flared instantly.

"What do you mean!" Lin Leman's voice suddenly became shrill.

Liang Yiming ignored her. "General Secretary Wang, push me into the room."

General Secretary Wang pushed Liang Yiming away, leaving Butler Liu behind to stop Lin Leman. "Miss Lin, Master Liang is not feeling well right now. Please take care of him."

"How can he say that? Does he still consider me his only family?" Lin Leman tried to argue, but Butler Liu kept stopping her, thinking to herself, "He's not his only family. He's just been expelled from Master Liang's social circle because of his greed, but those who remain are too irrational and will take advantage of me."

Butler Liu simply maintained a polite smile and firmly asked Lin Leman to rest in a guest room on the second floor.

Secretary Wang led Liang Yiming into the room. The first thing he saw was an intricately handmade carpet, a high ceiling, and a crystal chandelier that shimmered. A large sofa sat not far from the bed. It was raining outside, and a layer of damp, gray mist covered the windows.

It seemed that Mr. Liang didn't like returning to the old house. Even though Secretary Wang had been his secretary for many years, he rarely accompanied Mr. Liang back there.

But now that it wasn't convenient for Mr. Liang to appear in public, and the security was better here, they returned to the old house anyway.

While pushing the door open, Secretary Wang reported, "Mr. Liang, several groups of directors want to meet with you. We've appeased them, but we probably can't keep this a secret for long; we'll still need your intervention."

Secretary Wang looked down at Mr. Liang, whose eyes were slightly closed. "Also, quite a few CEOs have arranged for gifts and return presents to be sent to the group. I need your confirmation of those gifts and return presents."

Pushing open the door, Secretary Wang heard a bark. Robles was led into the room to keep Mr. Liang company for the night.

Secretary Wang patted Robles' head, emphasizing several people, such as General Manager Ye from the partner company, and Mr. Wang himself, etc., after making arrangements for each.

Secretary Wang sat on the sofa next to Master Liang, awaiting instructions, when he heard Master Liang ask, "Has Xia Sang been here?"

Robles, who had been lying at Liang Yiming's feet, raised his head, craning his neck and looking around, seemingly searching for someone as well.

Secretary Wang had already checked the information when he received it; Mr. Xia's name wasn't on it. But since Master Liang was blind, he feigned a few seconds of hesitation before answering, "No." Then, after a pause, he added, "Mr. Xia went back to his hometown, G City. Perhaps he didn't see it. I can contact him."

"No need," Liang Yiming said bluntly.

Xia Sang had only gone back to her hometown; it wasn't like her internet was cut off.

Besides, his two agents and assistant couldn't possibly be unaware of his situation.

Since she hadn't come, it meant she didn't care.

Liang Yiming stared into the darkness. He knew he was in trouble, and the fewer people who knew, the better. His relationship with Xia Sang was merely a matter of mutual benefit; whether Xia Sang came or not was her own business.

He didn't need to force anyone to visit him.

No need.

The general secretary, Wang, had no idea what Liang Yiming was thinking. He only saw his hands gripping the wheelchair, clenched into fists, his expression growing increasingly rigid.

He couldn't help but sigh. What good did it do to stubbornly endure it?

A flower that has been cut, no matter how carefully cared for, won't survive more than a few days.

The carnations in the Liang Group's break room withered within days. They were replaced, then withered again. From carnations to roses, from roses to sunflowers, people came and went, but few noticed.

Months later, everyone in the break room was discussing a major event—the group's CEO, Mr. Liang, who hadn't been to the company since the car accident, had gone blind.

His uncle, through a trusted retainer, had returned to the Liang Group, and Mr. Liang's aunt had moved from overseas to China.

A sense of unease gripped the company, reminding the veteran employees of the chaos that had ensued over a decade ago after Mr. Liang's father's death—another power struggle, both overt and covert.

One year later, G City, Xingwang Village.

"Brother Xia, you can't film like that," a boy in a tight-fitting shirt and jeans leaned against another boy in a white T-shirt, gesturing wildly as he looked at sample photos on the camera screen.

"Why not? Doesn't it look good?" Xia Sang asked Xiao Hong, looking at the footage on the camera.

Xiao Hong's image has changed drastically. She left Chenxing six months ago to become a beauty blogger. Having worked in the entertainment industry, she collaborated with many minor celebrity makeup artists to create celebrity makeup looks, and unknowingly amassed hundreds of thousands of followers, making her a minor internet celebrity. Now her clothing is more exaggerated—tight-fitting, adorned with a full array of accessories. If she weren't worried about startling the villagers, she'd even do her own makeup.

Xia Sang is the same; her hair is shaved short, and her once fair skin is now a light tan. When she smiles, her eyes slightly narrowed, making her look more cheerful and adorable than before.

The two of them, seeing each other, couldn't help but marvel at how quickly a year had passed.

Xiao Hong examined it closely. "It looks good, but it lacks a bit of hype. However, Brother Xia, your technique has definitely improved a lot."

"What's the use of good technique? I want to sell these bayberries," Xia Sang said.

"It's simple. To go viral, firstly, you need a script, and secondly, you need a theme that never goes out of style." Xiao Hong took out her phone. "Brother Xia, do you remember that video with a million likes?" Xiao Hong hinted.

"...Isn't it inappropriate to touch on something like that? Besides...it's not convenient for me." Although a year has passed and Xia Sang has completely disappeared from online discussions, he still worried about what might happen if someone found out.

Xia Sang was afraid it would negatively impact the e-commerce business everyone had worked so hard to build, since all his news was negative.

“Oh, no need for you,” Xiao Hong pointed to the person entering through the door. “Isn’t there a perfect guy right there!”

The person was Chen Anyang, the landlord Xia Sang rented a room from. He had graduated this year and returned home to help his family and village with their e-commerce business.

Chen Anyang sported a short buzz cut and wore a tank top. Sweat streamed down his strong arms, and his exposed skin was tanned a deep wheat color by the sun, making him look quite attractive.

Xiao Hong’s eyes lit up at the sight.

“Anyang, you graduated this year,” Xia Sang corrected him.

“I’ve eaten instant noodles that were a month past their expiration date, and even instant noodles that were just a few months past their expiration date can still be used,” Xiao Hong said with a sly grin, running up to Chen Anyang and whispering to him for a while.

Chen Anyang listened attentively at first, but then his face flushed red, and he shook his head frantically, running towards Xia Sang.

“Run? Go ahead and run!” Xiao Hong said, “Even your Xia-ge has been filmed, I can’t handle you!”

Chen Anyang abruptly stopped, his eyes widening in disbelief as he looked at Xia Sang, his gaze filled with shock and… a hint of barely perceptible curiosity.

Xia Sang felt awkward under her gaze and coughed twice. "Xiao Hong, if he doesn't want to, don't force him."

"Brother Xia!" Xiao Hong rushed to Xia Sang, gesturing wildly with her hands outstretched. "Brother Xia, just think about it, if we create another miracle, get a million likes, and one in every 100 people buys it, how many orders would that be?" "A full ten thousand orders! Just imagine how happy Sister Juan would be!"

Sister Juan was the village secretary. Xia Sang thought of Sister Juan's smiling face; he had promised to help her. He looked at Chen Anyang beside him, whose face was flushed, his eyes clear yet slightly bewildered. He took a deep breath, as if making a decision, and grabbed Chen Anyang's strong arm. "Anyang, listen to me, you can do it! For your dad!"

"I..." Chen Anyang looked at Xia Sang's face so close to his. He had always known Xia Sang was handsome, but now, with Xia Sang looking at him so closely, Chen Anyang felt as if his arm, which Xia Sang was holding, was on fire. A surge of heat rushed to his head, and his face felt as hot as if he could fry an egg on it. The words of refusal rolled in his throat, and in the end, without even realizing it, he nodded as if possessed.

Xia Sang quickly handed Chen Anyang to Xiao Hong, "Then Anyang is yours."

"Wait...wait a minute," Chen Anyang struggled, "Can I...see Xia-ge's video?"

"..." That's so old news, but seeing Chen Anyang's dog looking at her with teary eyes, Xia Sang gritted her teeth and said, "I'll show you when your video gets a million views."

After agreeing, Xiao Hong quickly filmed a video of Chen Anyang.

Red bayberries and juice were splashed on Chen Anyang, who was dressed like a farmer, then the scene transitioned to a handsome red-haired, tanned man with eight-pack abs, exuding charisma, before quickly ending with a mountain view and product advertisements.

Sure enough...it went viral. Although it didn't garner a million likes, it still received nearly 100,000, ultimately leading to almost a thousand orders, much to everyone's delight.

They couldn't help but marvel at how "playing it close to the edge" always works.

Xia Sang and Xiao Hong couldn't help but dream that An Yang would take a few more photos; perhaps by the time Sister Juan returned from the meeting in the city, they would already be on track.

For several days in a row, the group worked tirelessly, coordinating with villagers to harvest, pack, and finally manage to ship out the thousand boxes of product.

Suddenly, "Ding-dong!"

Another order came in through the system. Xiao Hong opened it and exclaimed, "Holy crap!!! Someone cleared out our entire inventory?!"

Xiao Hong immediately jumped up, muttering "We're rich! We're rich!" Her fingers trembled as she clicked on the details. In the buyer's information section—"Liang's Group, City B"
