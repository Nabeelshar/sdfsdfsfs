Chapter 62, 42, Secretary Wang (Revised)

"What?" Xia Sang, who was checking the shipping order, leaned closer to look. Xiao Hong instinctively hid behind her to cover it. "Nothing, just a big order."

Xia Sang looked at Xiao Hong's strange actions, pulled his hand away, and when he saw the orderer and address, he froze on the spot.

The air seemed to freeze. Birds chirped softly outside the window. The events in City B seemed like a long time ago.

An indescribable emotion slowly seeped out from her memories.

"...It's all my fault." Xiao Hong's voice carried a hint of guilt and remorse. "I filmed videos of our orchard and Anyang yesterday and posted them on my WeChat Moments, thinking I could help promote them, but I forgot to block them..."

Xia Sang took a deep breath. "No, we were going to do some promotion anyway." But why did she have to do it?

Xia Sang stared silently at her phone screen, exhaled, and dialed the number.

The phone was answered after only two rings.

Xia Sang picked up her phone and heard a familiar, long-lost voice.

“Hello, Liang Group.”

Xia Sang’s throat bobbed, her voice unexpectedly low and hoarse. “Hello…General Secretary Wang.”

There was silence on the other end of the line. After a few seconds, “Mr. Xia?” It was General Secretary Wang’s voice. “Hello, I didn’t expect… you actually called back.”

Xia Sang composed herself. “General Secretary Wang, I saw the order. Is the quantity a mistake…?”

“Mr. Xia, no.” General Secretary Wang’s tone was businesslike. “Liang Group regularly purchases employee welfare products. Seeing you and Mr. Hao Hong promoting poverty alleviation agricultural products, we think the quality and significance are excellent, and we should support it.”

General Secretary Wang’s tone and reasoning left Xia Sang speechless.

But Xia Sang still felt something was off.

Another thought flashed through her mind: was this idea Wang's or Liang's...?

Xia Sang unconsciously fell silent. The silence on the other end lasted even longer, as if someone was carefully choosing their words, and she could almost hear their breathing quicken.

"Mr. Xia..." Wang's voice was heavier than before, with a hint of pleading, "Actually, I do have something I'd like to ask you."

"Go ahead."

"Liang needs a caregiver. I was wondering if you're available recently? Do you have any ideas?"

"..."

Wang quickly added, "Mr. Xia, as long as you ask, the salary is negotiable."

Wang felt uneasy. He knew his request was somewhat abrupt, even excessive, for Xia Sang.

But he was helpless. Grandpa Liang's condition worsened day by day, and he became extremely sensitive and resistant to the new caregivers and doctors, and even to himself. Dr. Qin Lang had also been brought into the villa, but the treatment was ineffective.

The General Secretary's voice lowered slightly, "Mr. Xia, I know this request is presumptuous, and I know you have your own life… but Grandpa Liang is really having a hard time right now. He's blind, has difficulty moving, and has encountered many problems. He won't let anyone near him except for a few of us… and his temper has changed somewhat…" As the General Secretary spoke, his usually quick wit became clumsy and hesitant.

Xia Sang had already heard about Liang Yiming's eyes from Jin Ge and the others. "Liang Ye's eyes haven't improved yet?"

"Yes...not just his eyes, Robles...he was also poisoned." Secretary Wang's voice was filled with suppressed pain. "Just the day before yesterday. Someone scattered meat jerky mixed with xylitol on the lawn where it usually goes. Fortunately, Butler Liu discovered it in time and rushed it to the hospital. Its life was saved, but..." His voice choked, "The doctor said the toxin has caused severe damage to its kidneys, and...it might not live for many more years." "It's still at the vet... it's in very poor spirits..."

Secretary Wang's words exploded in Xia Sang's mind like a thunderbolt!

The image of Robles' fluffy, sun-kissed golden fur and wet, brown eyes flashed before his eyes.

Xia Sang's heart ached, and his eyes reddened.

Before, whenever he brought Robles a toy, Robles would happily cling to him like a little child. Sometimes... He was alone in the villa, and Robles would always snuggle up to him on the sofa, letting him cuddle and play with its paws and tail. It never got angry with him, clumsily trying to amuse him with toys.

Now it's in the hospital?!

Pain spread through Xia Sang's heart. He gripped his phone tightly, his knuckles turning white from the force. His nose stung, his eyes instantly welled up, and his vision blurred. "Who did this?!"

"We've caught the culprit," said Secretary Wang, his voice weary and heavy. "After Mr. Liang lost his sight, we've been training Robles to be his guide dog." "It's clever. Maybe it's blocking someone's way, or someone's trying to provoke Master Liang..."

Xia Sang felt a chill run from his feet to the top of his head! These people wouldn't even spare a dog?!

Insane!

Just how black are those people's hearts?!

Xia Sang's teeth ached from clenching them.

"So, Mr. Xia, could you please..." Hearing this, Xia Sang felt his head was about to explode.

He didn't understand why Secretary Wang was begging him to do anything.

He wasn't a doctor, he wasn't the kind of person Master Liang liked, and he didn't meet Master Liang's standards for a future partner. Wasn't that lady from that day perfect?

He was just a contractual lover.

Xia Sang kept telling himself this, trying to convince himself, but deep down he kept asking himself, could he really be so heartless?

Xia Sang looked up. The sunlight streaming through the window was perfect, dappling the ground with light filtering through the bayberry leaves, making the abundant fruit seem to droop precariously on the branches.

Xia Sang calmed himself and wiped his face.

He remembered Sister Juan's trusting gaze.

No, he had promised Sister Juan he would help her with the village's poverty alleviation efforts by selling fruit. He couldn't break his promise; he had to help.

He said earnestly to Secretary Wang, "Secretary Wang, I'm sorry. The bayberries in the village are ripe, and I have to stay and help Sister Juan."

Secretary Wang didn't know who Sister Juan was; he simply said hastily, "Mr. Xia, we'll buy all the bayberries in your village."

"All of them?" Xia Sang asked in surprise.

"All of them." "Secretary Wang."

Xia Sang was stunned. He hadn't expected Secretary Wang to say that.

Even Xiao Hong, standing beside him, was stunned. Just moments ago, Xiao Hong had thought Xia Ge was too honest; a few hundred boxes of orders was nothing to the Liang Group, and it would be foolish not to take advantage of such a bargain. But now, with such a huge opportunity right in front of them, Xiao Hong didn't dare to say anything. How could this be considered a competition for a position!

After waiting a while,

he finally heard Xia Sang's voice.

"Secretary Wang, I'm sorry, I've been away for over a year. I believe you are capable of taking good care of Master Liang. As for Robles, once its condition stabilizes, let me know, and I'll go see it immediately. Thank you for your help." Xia Sang's voice was gentle yet firm at the end, "If possible, I would also like to visit Master Liang then." "

A few seconds of waiting...

"I understand." Secretary Wang didn't press further. "I'm sure Robles will be very happy to see you; he still has a few of your clothes in his den." He chuckled softly.

"Thank you, Secretary Wang," Xia Sang whispered, hanging up the phone.

The room fell silent the moment the call ended.
