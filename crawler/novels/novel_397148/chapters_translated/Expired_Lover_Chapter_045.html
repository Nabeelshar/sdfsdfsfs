◇ Chapter 69, Section 44: Pitiful (Bonus Chapter)

"Xia Sang, you didn't need to come."

Xia Sang stood at the doorway, her fingers unconsciously clenching and unclenching.

A year had passed, and the villa, after a cleaning, was furnished exactly the same as before.

Only the person on the sofa seemed different.

He saw Liang Yiming finish speaking, lean forward slightly, straightening his back even more, but his face remained turned.

Xia Sang was somewhat stunned, and Secretary Wang also looked troubled. Why had Master Liang suddenly spoken so harshly? He gave Xia Sang a reassuring look.

Xia Sang pursed her lips, smiled slightly, and slowly began to speak, "Master Liang, it's been a long time. I've come to visit you today."

Liang Yiming scoffed, "If you wanted to visit, you wouldn't come for a year." His smile widened with sarcasm. "Have you run out of money?"

With that, Liang Yiming gripped the sofa tightly.

For a moment, no one spoke.

Liang Yiming knew perfectly well how harsh his words had been.

His vision went dark; he strained to hear every sound around him.

He was trying to guess Xia Sang's reaction. Would she be angry, confused, or would she slam the door and leave?

Perhaps Xia Sang was only visiting out of pity for him, but he was still venting his emotions on her.

But he couldn't help himself.

Xia Sang had always been a bit of a pushover, always saying, "It's okay, he didn't mean it," no matter how someone might unintentionally offend him.

But this pushover had never come back to see him even once.

Thinking of this, Liang Yiming felt a tickle in his teeth. He tapped his fingertips on the wheelchair handle, but even his throat itched; he wanted a cigarette.

He tried to suppress the inexplicable feeling in his heart. He shouldn't have any resentment towards Xia Sang, but at this moment, those dark thoughts in his mind were impossible to suppress.

If Xia Sang had no feelings for him, she wouldn't have come a year ago, and she shouldn't have come now either.

Did she come back now just to see him in such a sorry state?

As he thought this, Liang Yiming particularly wanted to see Xia Sang's expression. Would it be mockery, or surprise at how he had become?

He said sarcastically, "A year apart, and you've forgotten how to speak."

"Not really," Xia Sang said softly, carefully considering her words, "It's just that I don't know what to say."

Xia Sang thought for a moment. She honestly answered Liang Yiming's previous question, "I still have money." He hadn't spent much in Xingwang Village. Although Sister Juan didn't have a high salary, she provided him with food and lodging subsidies. He'd only spent money on donations and photography equipment; he hadn't actually used much.

"Uncle Liang, I'm actually quite wealthy now." He still had several million.

Xia Sang didn't dare say the last part aloud.

Standing to the side, Secretary Wang abruptly lowered his head, biting his lip, almost suppressing a laugh.

Liang Yiming clenched his fist, unable to resist, and smashed the glass in his hand with a crash—"Then get out!"

Liang Yiming listened intently to the direction of Xia Sang's voice.

Only then did Xia Sang get a clear look at Liang Yiming.

His cheeks were noticeably thinner, his eyes unfocused, and his trembling chin bore two pink scratches, perhaps from shaving—Master Liang used to enjoy hand shaving—and faint dark circles under his eyes…

Xia Sang hadn't expected Master Liang to be so enraged over such a small matter.

Further down, he was still wearing gloves, but unlike the thin material before, they were now thick and layered.

He looked closely and noticed how much more haggard Liang Yiming had become.

Xia Sang's eyes and nose squinted together, and she felt a strange sting.

How could this be? It shouldn't be like this.

Master Liang was such a proud man.

How much hatred must he harbor?

Xia Sang blinked, and a tear rolled down her cheek…

When Secretary Wang saw Xia Sang's tear fall, he glanced at Master Liang again and quietly slipped out.

Time doesn't increase or decrease, but if time loses its color, darkness can prolong the feeling of time.

Liang Yiming clearly heard footsteps; he felt someone approaching him, but he heard no further movement. The waiting was agonizing.

Until he heard a soft sob, his breath hitched for a moment.

Was Xia Sang crying?

The next moment, he wasn't sure if the sound was Xia Sang's.

Was Xia Sang crying for him?

He heard someone slowly approach, and that person gently embraced him.

He should hate being touched, yet he seemed strangely familiar with the warmth of that embrace.

Before Liang Yiming could figure it out, his arms were already around the other person's waist.

The next moment, he wondered again, was Xia Sang pitying him?

Was she pitying him?

The word "pitiful" gnawed at his nerves like a venomous snake.

Liang Yiming used to say Xia Sang and Robles were alike, but he actually thought Xia Sang was more like a sparrow that could nestle in his palm—docile, petite, and obedient.

Just like now, amidst that soft sob, another kind of longing stirred within him. He almost uncontrollably reached out, grabbed Xia Sang, and pulled her forcefully towards him. The touch of their embrace, transmitted through the fabric, briefly quelled the itch.

“You came back to take care of me?” Liang Yiming asked.

The person in his palm froze, then replied, “No.”

“Master Liang, I still have a job in G City.”

No. That was a rejection.

If she was rejecting him, why did she come to see him make a fool of himself!

"Get out." Liang Yiming opened his eyes, his gaze unfocused. Xia Sang stared directly into Liang Ye's eyes, as if frozen in place.

Before she could react, Liang Ye, radiating an icy aura, said firmly, "You, get out immediately!"

...
Xia Sang went downstairs, and Jin Fulai and Xiao Hong surrounded her, anxiously asking, "Why did you come down so quickly? Did you see Liang Ye? How is he?"

Xia Sang shook her head slightly. "I saw him, but Liang Ye told me to leave."

"What happened? Is it..." Xiao Hong was about to say something when she felt her arm being tugged. It was Jin Fulai.

Xia Sang's expression was clearly off.

"Then we'll go first. We'll talk about it when we get back." Jin Fulai led the two away from the villa in his car.

...

That night, Qin Lang returned to the villa and went straight to Liang Yiming's bedroom.

Liang Yiming was listening to an audiobook, one of the few times he was relatively calm. "Master Liang, how did your chat with Xia Sang go?" Qin Lang sat casually on the sofa. Liang Yiming had led him away this morning to prevent him from running into Xia Sang.

Liang Yiming ignored him.

"I heard you made her cry, is that true?" Qin Lang didn't care, picking up an apple from the fruit plate and eating it. "Tell me, what did you two talk about? Don't be so petty."

"You're disturbing me," Liang Yiming said indifferently.

Qin Lang's voice was loud, and the crunching sound of him eating the apple was loud. An inexplicable anger rose within Liang Yiming.

Just as Qin Lang was about to speak, the speaker slammed down on the floor. "Shut up, get out!"

Qin Lang was startled. Liang Yiming's temper had been getting worse lately, but this was the first time he'd openly vented it on him.

"You're acting like a complaining woman, dumped?" Qin Lang didn't leave, but continued, "Taking your anger out on me."

"Get out!" Liang Yiming said in a low, menacing voice.

"Fine, no problem." Qin Lang stood up. "Master Liang, you have to say what you want. Being so stubborn won't get you anyone's pity. How are you going to pursue someone like this?"

He then walked out the door, leaving Liang Yiming to process his feelings.

Qin Lang thought about it, becoming increasingly curious about Xia Sang. Someone who could make Liang Yiming lose his temper was certainly capable; he could be put to use.
