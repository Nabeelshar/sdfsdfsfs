Chapter 70, Section 45: Anger (Supplement)

"Mommy, can you hug me?" A seven or eight-year-old boy in a black suit quietly followed behind his mother, his big eyes pleading.

Ever since his father and brother died in a car accident, his mother had kept him confined at home, forbidding him to go out. Teachers came to the house regularly, leaving immediately after class. The large old house was empty except for the housekeeper and maid, but they ignored him. He had no friends at home.

He didn't want to cause trouble for anyone.

Little Liang Yiming comforted himself, "I'm a man, I can manage."

After class, he would play in the garden. When he got tired of that, he would go back to the living room to watch cartoons.

He stared at his puppy friend on TV, mouth agape, his chubby little face filled with envy, murmuring, "I want a puppy too."

Just then, the beautiful, adorable golden retriever cartoon puppy on the TV was bouncing around its little owner. The next second, the cartoon boy and the dog got into trouble, and his mother got really angry.

Little Liang Yiming clenched his little fists, his face turning pale with tension.

All he could hear was his mother's voice—

"Mom is doing this because she loves you, you know?"

"Mingming, we've already lost Dad and Brother, you can't let anything happen to you."

...
"Mingming, I will definitely protect what belongs to you."

"That's your father's hard work, it's definitely yours."

...
"Do you know how hard I've worked!"

"They all want to take it."

"They all bully me! Bully me!"

"I won't give up, I won't give up!"

His mother looked like someone he had never seen before. The mother who used to stroke his hair was gone. This mother would only stand at a distance, quietly watching him, her dark eyes like a net that captured him.

He was afraid, but still wanted to get close to her, only to be rejected time and again.

"I don't have time to play with you."

"Have you finished your homework?"

"How can you compare to your brother like this?"

"How can you be so weak? How can you be so much less smart than your brother!"

...

Is Mom starting to dislike him?

...

Little Yiming felt a lump in his throat, his lips trembled, and tears clung to his lips, tasting salty.

The cartoon was still playing. On TV, the older brother hugged his mother, and the mother's anger subsided. She kissed her brother's head and made him dinner.

Little Yiming sat up somewhat awkwardly; he wanted to hug his mother too.

After a hug, maybe Mom will feel better, and she won't be angry anymore.

"Mommy, can you hug me?"

The woman, with her wavy hair and heavy makeup, was drinking water from a glass in the kitchen, yelling into her phone, "What happened today? Didn't you check before you did it? If you can't do it, don't do it!"

Finally getting a chance to see his mother, Liang Yiming, unwilling to give up, continued, repeating, "Mommy, I want to hug you, Mommy."

Lin Leyao watched Liang Yiming scurrying around like a fly, the kettle on the table gurgling loudly. It was too noisy, too noisy.

"Don't bother me!" She shoved Liang Yiming away. "Go back to your room and study now."

Liang Yiming stumbled a few steps, his mouth covered, tears streaming down his face. Lin Leyao was even more annoyed by the sight.

Crying, crying, crying—he was nothing compared to Yi'an.

If only Yi'an hadn't died…

Thinking this, the next second, Lin Leyao slapped herself. What was she thinking? Was she crazy?

She looked at Yiming, who resembled Yi'an by eight-tenths, trying to approach her, as if he were a monster. Don't come any closer!

"Mom…"

Don't come any closer.

She swung her hand and slapped him.

Her palm burned with pain. What had she just hit?

"Clang—"

Something fell down…

"Ah—ah—"

Why is Yi Ming crying? Why is his hand bleeding…

Lin Leyao stared blankly at her hands, covered in nail polish, bright red nail polish, "Ah—"

The scene was chaotic. The housekeeper rushed over to contact a doctor, the maid comforted the wife, and the housekeeper kept asking the doctor if she would be alright.

In the shadows, Liang Yi Ming knew the outcome. She wouldn't be, but she would be scarred, ugly scars, her hands covered in scars.

He calmly watched everything in his dream, as if the person in it wasn't his childhood self, like an outsider.

He only felt bored, so bored that time seemed to drag on, but he didn't struggle to wake up. This was one of the few scenes he could see after he went blind.

It wasn't endless darkness.

Thinking this, he opened his eyes the next moment.

The darkness before him was even more tedious than a dream.

Liang Yiming's breathing quickened; a heaviness in his chest seemed to suffocate him, and anger rose—the itch in his heart resurfaced.

He thought of Xia Sang again.

The warmth of their embrace during the day vaguely reappeared on his fingertips; in the darkness, that faint, indistinct warmth was magnified infinitely.

Liang Yiming sat up abruptly, the movement carrying a hint of ruthlessness. He groped for the edge of the bed, exhaled deeply, touched the headboard, and adjusted it to an arm's length distance—his usual getting-out-of-bed position since losing his sight.

He stood up, counting his steps, like a puppet rehearsing countless times on stage, walking one step after another, precise and rigid.

He turned; there was a cabinet.

His fingertips traced the cabinet surface beforehand, as if confirming his location, before continuing.

He turned left; there was a sofa.

He sat down, reaching out his right hand. A cigarette pack and ashtray sat on the lower right corner of the table.

Liang Yiming opened the cigarette pack, running his hand over the top of the lighter; it felt heavy and cold.

"Click—"

He opened it, lit it, closed his eyes, and thought of Xia Sang again.

Why did she come back?

Why did she cry?

"Why are you always jumping around in front of me?"

Meanwhile, after finding Liang Yiming, Qin Lang returned to his guest room and took a shower.

Wearing a loose bathrobe, he slumped onto the chair at his desk, staring at the ceiling. He picked up his phone and dialed a number, which was quickly answered.

"Hello~ Good evening, Secretary Wang~" Qin Lang drawled, his voice slightly cloying.

"Good evening, Mr. Qin." It was Secretary Wang's voice.

"As soon as I got back today, Mr. Liang threw a tantrum at me. What happened between Mr. Liang and Xia Sang?"

"Mr. Qin, that's Mr. Liang's private matter, I can't say." Secretary Wang replied curtly.

"Just a casual chat."

The other party remained silent.

Qin Lang couldn't help but roll his eyes. One argumentative boss was enough, but now he had a taciturn subordinate. “Tell me, will Liang Yiming dock your pay, or will the Liang Group's stock plummet?”

“…”

“Fine, fine, I won’t tell you. Just give me Xia Sang’s contact information.” Qin Lang was too lazy to argue with the taciturn man.

“…” Secretary Wang hesitated for a moment, “Mr. Xia wasn’t in a good mood when he left today.”

“Nonsense, your boss would be lucky to even fart if he hit you with a stick.” Qin Lang chuckled.

Besides, Master Liang wasn’t in a good mood either, but he didn’t think it was a bad thing.

As he spoke, Qin Lang took a notebook from a drawer in his desk, “It’s not a bad thing that people argue; the worst thing is when someone suffocates from a fit of anger.”

With Xia Sang here, Liang Yiming will lose face and won’t be able to keep up the pretense anymore, right?

“Don’t say so much, just send the call.” Qin Lang urged, but the chief secretary, Wang, remained silent.

“I’m a licensed doctor, a law-abiding citizen. I won’t harm or kidnap anyone, OK?” Qin Lang was speechless. “I just want to understand the situation.”

“…”

“Do you still want someone to take care of Liang Yiming?”

“…”

“Do you still want to treat Master Liang’s illness?”

The chief secretary remained silent for even longer. He knew Qin Lang wouldn’t harm Xia Sang, but he didn’t know what Qin Lang wanted from Xia Sang. Finally, he sighed and said, “Okay.”

“Alright, I’ll hang up then.”

After hanging up, Qin Lang opened the booklet in front of him—this was Liang Yiming’s medical record.

He wasn’t Liang Yiming’s first psychiatrist.

Liang Yiming was someone he took over from his teacher after the latter went abroad. He had already read the booklet at the beginning, and later added some additional notes.

The first page shows Liang Yiming's first consultation.

He was 16 years old.

He found the number online and called.

The booklet records Liang Yiming's first words: "Hello, I think I'm sick, can you treat me?"

The 16-year-old Liang Yiming explained his family situation and problems.

At that time, he discovered he had skin hunger syndrome.

He even calmly asked, "Am I a pervert?"

His teacher's comment for Liang Yiming: First, let the patient understand and accept themselves.

After several more conversations, and having gained Liang Yiming's trust, the teacher proceeded to a face-to-face consultation.

The result revealed that the most serious problem for Liang Yiming was not his own illness, but rather his mother's…
