◇ Chapter 57 37 Unexpected Events (Supplement)

In the front seat of the car, Secretary Wang cautiously peered at Mr. Liang's face through the rearview mirror—his expression was as cold as frost, his thin lips pressed into a sharp line.

Secretary Wang hesitated before speaking, trying to break the suffocating silence, "Mr. Liang, that Hao Hong is just a junior employee, she doesn't know the rules. Perhaps I should contact Mr. Xia to see if..."

"No need."

Before he could finish, Mr. Liang's three words cut him off crisply, leaving no room for negotiation.

Secretary Wang could only agree, a sense of unease creeping into his heart.

Half a month after Xia Sang left, Liang Yiming moved back to the familiar villa halfway up the mountain. Robles was brought back with him, happily hopping around on the lawn, wagging its tail and wandering around the garden, playing with the flowers and plants.

Seeing Robles' excited appearance, Butler Liu smiled and said, "Roboles still prefers it here; it's much more lively than at the old house."

Cook Huang also smiled at Robles and casually said, "It ran to the swing; it's probably looking for Mr. Xia..." Before she could finish, Cook Huang immediately shut up, hurriedly wiping her hands. Seeing that Master Liang didn't speak, she made an excuse and went back to the kitchen.

Robles seemed to truly understand Xia Sang's name. His rolling on the grass abruptly stopped, his dark eyes suddenly lighting up. He pricked up his ears and hurried into the villa, sniffing every corner where Xia Sang had lingered—by the sofa, at the corner of the stairs, in the sunroom… Liang Yiming followed behind, suddenly realizing that Xia Sang had left traces there.

After circling many times, still unable to find her, Robles returned to his feet, pacing anxiously, emitting low, disappointed and confused growls.

Liang Yiming lowered his gaze, watching Robles pacing around in circles, unable to find the familiar face.

He slowly said, "Don't look anymore, she's not here."

The Liang family's business empire was thriving, and those with ulterior motives flocked to Liang Yiming. A series of banquets and gatherings, filled with elegantly dressed women and clinking glasses, presented Liang Yiming with a dazzling array of beautiful faces:

"Mr. Liang, you look so good lately..."

"It seems quieter around you, Mr. Liang? What a coincidence, I have someone..."

"Mr. Liang, I heard you prefer quiet and well-behaved women? My cousin..."

"..."
The probing and fawning in their words were blatant and direct.

In just one month, the name "Xia Sang" vanished like a drop of water dropped into the ocean.

No one mentioned it again.

So much so that when he sat in the therapy room, hearing Qin Lang ask him how Xia Sang was doing, he was somewhat dazed.

"They broke up," he replied.

"What's the reason?"

"..." Liang Yiming didn't answer immediately.

Qin Lang sat opposite Liang Yiming, looking at him, and sighed silently.

He was in a terrible state.

Although Liang Yiming sat upright, his suit was still impeccably tailored, even his cufflinks reflecting a refined gleam.

But the weariness radiating from the depths of his eyes, and the almost palpable anxiety hidden beneath his restraint...

couldn't be faked.

“Master Liang, I’ve told you before, you can’t always resist.” Qin Lang’s tone was deeply worried, yet tinged with a familiar helplessness. “Resisting your true needs and feelings will only make you more miserable. You’re better than you were a few years ago, but you’re not cured. Even some who seem cured experience relapses.”

Liang Yiming’s brows furrowed even deeper.

“You need to satisfy your desires. If that’s gone, why don’t you find another one?” Qin Lang probed.

“No need,” Liang Yiming interrupted him, his tone cold and hard.

Qin Lang had a headache; Liang Yiming was so stubborn that he couldn’t be reasoned with. "Then win Xia Sang back."

"No."

"This won't work, that won't work," Qin Lang said. "Didn't you say you had feelings for him?"

"I do have feelings for him, but it's not love."

"Then what is love?" Qin Lang leaned forward slightly, asking Liang Yiming, "What exactly constitutes love in your heart? Can feelings be divided so clearly?" Qin Lang's voice softened, trying to coax Liang Yiming into saying more, "Payment accurate to the decimal point."

"Yes." Liang Yiming didn't hesitate at all.

"How do you calculate it?" Qin Lang continued to press.

Liang Yiming seemed to see through Qin Lang's attempt to guide him. He scoffed, "How do you calculate it? If you, Qin Lang, didn't have any ability, would you and I even have a chance to sit down and chat?"

Achievements, money, anything can be measured; everything has a standard.

If you're not strong, you'll be swallowed up.

Qin Lang seemed drained of strength, slumping back into the sofa. "Fine, I still hope this isn't a war between us. You don't need to win against me, but to trust me, regardless of right or wrong, to open your heart."

Silence spread in the consultation room. Sunlight, cut into strips by the lilac window, cast a cage-like shadow at Liang Yiming's feet.

Liang Yiming's lips tightened even more.

Finally, Qin Lang, at his wit's end, reluctantly conceded, "Fine. I can only prescribe some sedatives and nerve tonics, but you know these are just temporary fixes."

Stepping out of the clinic, the bustling city was filled with noise.

Liang Yiming leaned back in the seat. Today, Secretary Wang was at the company; only the driver had brought him. The car was quiet, save for the faint hum of the air conditioner.

As if possessed, he picked up his phone and opened his chat with Xia Sang. It had been a long time.

The call history showed Xia Sang calling him late at night saying she was hungry.

Back then, the scandal of the sugar daddy/sugar baby scandal broke, and he and Xia Sang hadn't seen each other for a long time. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, he received a call from Xia Sang. Her voice was slightly distorted by the electricity, but he could hear the panic in her voice.

He sat up and chatted with Xia Sang, quietly waiting for her to speak. Finally, he heard, "I'm hungry."

He couldn't help but laugh in the darkness. He knew it was an excuse, but he felt a strange pleasure.

Liang Yiming's fingers lightly touched the screen. Would people fade with time?

The car reached an intersection.

The red light came on, and the car stopped at the intersection.

The scarlet countdown ticked away, 60…59…58… At the same time, a heavy, dilapidated red truck also stopped at the intersection to the side.

Inside the car, Liang Yiming thought that perhaps he could show some concern for Xia Sang.

For example, by making a phone call.

The red light countdown ended, and the light turned green.

Liang Yiming's car started moving, but the large truck that should have been stopping instead violated the rules, accelerating!

It drove straight towards Liang Yiming's car!

The driver, a man around fifty years old, was so thin he was almost emaciated, his cheeks deeply sunken, his lips trembling nervously, and his cloudy eyes fixed on Liang Yiming's expensive luxury car ahead.

His voice was hoarse, and he muttered, "Impossible, it couldn't be me who killed them. It's all these rich people, they're all liars! They're all liars!"

He shook his head incessantly, looking completely deranged.

Hit him!

Hit him!

The hanging ornament on the front window of the truck was severed by flying glass and landed outside the truck; it was a photo of a family of three.

If anyone saw it, they might find the people in the picture very familiar.

Their appearance—exactly the same as the family in the tragic case earlier this year, after the Liang Group launched a new drug, whose failure to follow the doctor's orders resulted in the deaths of the wife and daughter.

Boom—!!!

A deafening roar instantly drowned out all the noise…

Liang Yiming's car was thrown out of control.

The accident happened too fast.

Liang Yiming's gaze was still fixed on Xia Sang's name on his phone.

He sensed the danger and turned his head, only to see the car hurtling towards him from the side and rear with an irresistible force!

The car, like a toy being violently swung, spun, rolled, and crashed out of control!

His phone slipped from his hand,

the seatbelt instantly dug into his flesh,

and excruciating pain shot through his entire body!

All he could see were shards of glass flying everywhere, and screams filled his ears. Liang Yiming's mind went blank. Pain, tension, suffocation—thoughts raced:

Who was it? Was it an accident? Would he die? What would happen to the company…?

The car rolled twice and came to a stop.

The driver in front was in a daze, his neck hanging from the seatbelt.

Warm liquid, carrying a strong rusty smell, blurred his vision with its blood-red hue. All he could hear was a sharp ringing in his ears and the faint shouts from afar.

He reached out, trying to unbuckle the seatbelt, but his mind went blank. Boundless thoughts and a fog of inexplicable emotions suddenly crashed down like a boulder. Liang Yiming thought, what about Xia Sang?

He should have called Xia Sang.

He was just concerned about Xia Sang's situation.

Knowing would perhaps alleviate his doubts and guilt.

Thinking this, he vaguely saw many people gathered around his car window. He unconsciously searched,

Xia…Sang…

Liang Yiming's trembling fingers forcefully unbuckled his seatbelt. With a "click," his body went limp, and his last vestiges of consciousness faded away…
