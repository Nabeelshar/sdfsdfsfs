Chapter 9 09 Grandma Xia

Xia Sang looked at the tie in her hand, realizing she really liked it. Whenever Grandpa Liang hadn't chosen a style, he would subconsciously wear it.

“Should we change it?” Xia Sang asked.

“No need.”

After saying that, Liang Yiming dressed, went downstairs, and took his car to work.

In the car, as he listened to Secretary Wang recount the day's schedule, he recalled the first time he met Xia Sang; she was wearing this very tie.

At that time, he was visiting the set of the newly invested S drama. After watching for a while, he got bored and went for a walk. He unknowingly wandered into a small theater, where a boy wearing a long-sleeved shirt was hiding in the shadows of a tent.

The boy turned his head back and forth several times after seeing him, his face flushed, whether from the heat or shyness, it was hard to tell. After a while, the boy seemed to have made up his mind and ran out, bringing him a bottle of water and a small fan.

“Brother, which film crew are you with?”

“Next door.”

“Next door…it seems to be the ‘I’m a Charmer’ theater…” the boy muttered softly, “Are you a lead actor?”

“No.” Liang Yiming, holding the water in his hand, was in a good mood and patiently answered the other's question.

“A supporting role.”

Liang Yiming shook his head.

"So you're just another cannon fodder extra like me!" The boy suddenly seemed to have found his group, beaming with joy. Realizing he'd been too excited, he became a little embarrassed. "I didn't expect you to be so handsome! And just an extra."

Seeing the boy about to say something, a man in his thirties came out of the theater where Liang Yiming had just been, shouting loudly, "Xia Sang, come back! Come back! It's your turn! Hurry up! The director's going to yell at you!"

"Oh, oh..." The boy then fumbled around, seemingly without his phone. The man on the other end kept urging, "Xia Sang! What are you doing?!"

"We...we'll see you next time! My name is Xia Sang, next time! See you next time!" He looked at him disappointedly and hurriedly left.

Before Liang Yiming could respond, the boy quickly left, returning to the scene.

That was the first time Liang Yiming met Xia Sang.

Passionate, youthful.

For a fleeting moment, an itchy sensation traveled from her gaze to his body. Perhaps it was because of that instant that he gave Xia Sang the opportunity to get close to him when they met again, and later it proved that Xia Sang was a good lover.

If Xia Sang obediently remained just a lover, that would be even better. Liang Yiming thought somewhat coldly.

As soon as Xia Sang arrived at the company, Jin Fulai called him over to watch the new variety show introduction and potential offer. He opened it; the cover prominently displayed the variety show's name—"Internship, My Dear Dad!"

"My dear? Dad?" Jin Fulai recalled what Xia Sang had told him about Liang Ye's quirks. Really? Liang Ye was so promiscuous.

"A single guy going on a children's variety show?" Xia Sang asked doubtfully. "Me, a children's variety show?"

"Children's variety shows are great! I think they're perfect for Brother Xia!" Xiao Hong immediately thought of the show's appeal.

The two looked at him, and Xiao Hong continued, "Look, if it's a singing, dancing, acting, or variety show, Brother Xia might not stand out; he might be invisible on stage. But on a children's variety show, Brother Xia is handsome even without makeup, has a good temper, and if he's lucky, he might get a lot of screen time. Plus, kids are less calculating, and the guests shouldn't be too complicated. Even if he's not great, he shouldn't cause any major trouble. So, isn't it perfect for Brother Xia to go on this?"

Jin Fulai listened to Xiao Hong's explanation... After careful consideration, Xi nodded in agreement. "Xiao Hong is right, it's a safe bet. It seems this resource is quite suitable."

"Right? It feels like the resources Liang-ye gives are always just right." Xiao Hong finished speaking and was glared at by Jin-ge, who warned, "Don't betray us."

Xiao Hong chuckled sheepishly, "No, no, I'm definitely on Xia-ge's side."

"Internship, Dear Dad!" is a brand new trial program for children's variety shows produced by Chenxing. It's a one-month-long challenge show featuring celebrities and five high-value ordinary children. The core is watching the lives of "celebrity new dads" raising their adorable children.

Currently, it's in the recruitment phase; the other celebrities haven't been announced yet.

Jin Fulai, seeing that everything seemed perfect for Xia Sang, said, "No problem, then it's decided. I'll let them know it's settled."

"Okay."

After deciding to participate in the children's variety show, Xia Sang spent several days researching it with Jin and the others. By the end, Xia Sang felt like she was starting to sound like a baby, using reduplicated words.

Before leaving today, Jin suddenly said, "Tomorrow's Sunday, do you want to see Grandma? I'll pick you up. What about Grandpa Liang?"

"Okay."

Xia Sang had moved back to Grandpa Liang's villa, but she kept the apartment. If Grandpa Liang was away on business or in special circumstances, Xia Sang would stay there.

The next day, Xia Sang woke up to find Grandpa Liang already out. He was currently preparing for the launch of a new drug and had been going to work early these past few days.

As Xia Sang was about to leave, Butler Liu asked, "Xia, going out?"

"Yes."

"Do you want me to arrange a car to take you out?"

"No need, Butler Liu, I've already arranged it with my agent."

"Will you come back for dinner?"

"I don't know, I'll call you when I get back."

"Okay, okay, be careful."

Jin Fulai arrived at the villa area halfway up the mountain to pick up Xia Sang at the agreed time. After a long drive along a loop road, Xia Sang first bought a bouquet of lilies at a flower shop, then drove to the city hospital and went up to the VIP ward on the sixteenth floor.

In the hospital room, an elderly woman with a full head of white hair lay on a pristine white bed. Her sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles and age spots. The sun shone brightly today, and the window was slightly ajar under the temperature-controlled air conditioning. The lilies by the bedside were in full bloom, their last moments in bloom.

Xia Sang gently pushed open the door and softly called out, "Grandma, I'm here."

The old woman didn't move.

Xia Sang went over and replaced the flowers in the vase with fresh ones. Then she sat down by the bed to trim Grandma Xia's nails. Jin Fulai sat beside her, indulging in his incessant chatter. The whole room felt warm and cozy, but unfortunately, Grandma Xia remained completely still throughout.

When Xia Sang was nineteen, she worked as an extra at a film studio every day. Her grandmother often suffered from headaches, but to save money, she endured them. When Xia Sang noticed the problem, she would say it was due to old age and try to fool her. This continued until she no longer needed painkillers. One day, she fainted at home. Fortunately, Xia Sang got off work early that day and rushed her grandmother to the hospital.

An examination revealed that her grandmother had a large brain tumor, making surgery very risky.

Furthermore, the surgery would incur a huge expense.

Although the surgery was successful, due to its deep location and large area, coupled with her poor physical condition, her wound became infected shortly after the surgery, ultimately leaving her in a vegetative state.

Xia Sang visits her grandmother regularly, hoping that one day her grandmother will wake up.

Sadly, nearly two years have passed, and Grandma Xia hasn't shown any response.

After the visit, Xia Sang and Jin Ge prepared to leave.

This time, the doctor stopped Xia Sang. "The patient is quite old, and has many complications. It's a significant burden on her body. You should always be prepared."

Xia Sang felt a pang of sorrow. Grandma had given him his life, but he hadn't given her a single day of peace.

Xia Sang didn't remember how he replied to the doctor.

Jin Ge, seeing Xia Sang's state, also felt a deep sadness.

The two drove until they reached a traffic light at an intersection before Jin Ge hesitantly spoke, "Xia Sang, we've done our best."

Hearing this, Xia Sang, who had been holding back her tears, inexplicably let them fall.

He knew he had tried his best, but he still couldn't accept it.

He had tried his best, so why did this still happen?

Xia Sang returned to the villa. Grandpa Liang was outside discussing business and wouldn't be back until very late.

He sat alone on the balcony of the master bedroom. Moonlight streamed into the room, casting a serene, deep blue hue, as if the room were submerged in the ocean.

He stared blankly outside, the dark night wind ruffling his black hair. Xia Sang picked up the cigarettes Grandpa Liang had left on the balcony.

Xia Sang actually smoked, but he didn't because his grandmother disliked it. She would nag about how Xia Sang had been sickly as a child, how smoking was bad for his health, and how she hoped Xia Sang would live a long and healthy life.

So before he even fully understood what he was doing, he decided he would never smoke again.

But now, for some reason, Xia Sang wanted one. He clumsily lit it, took a deep drag, and before he could swallow, the smoke choked him, causing him to cough a few times, and a few tears welled up in his eyes.

He covered his mouth, his eyes reddening, and made soft sobbing sounds.

He thought the cigarette smelled good, unlike the thick, lingering stench of stale cigarettes he used to smell in his cheap lodgings, but it still pungent.
