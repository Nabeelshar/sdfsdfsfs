Chapter 29, Part 10: Liang Yize (Revised)

Liang Yiming attended a new drug discussion meeting tonight. The drug had entered its final stage and was about to be launched.

After its launch, the profits would be enormous, which would undoubtedly elevate the wealth and status of Liang, the biggest investor. Several CEOs, eager to curry favor with Liang, offered him congratulatory drinks.

Liang was in a good mood and drank quite a bit with them, becoming somewhat drunk and hazy.

When Secretary Wang brought him back, Xia Sang was already nestled in bed. He assumed she was asleep.

But when he finished showering and lay down, he found Xia Sang slowly turning over and embracing him.

At first, Liang Yiming didn't notice anything amiss. "Still not asleep?"

"Slept, then woke up again."

Liang Yiming thought he'd woken him up, so he closed his eyes, patted his head, and was about to rest when he inadvertently smelled a faint scent of cigarettes, and even alcohol. He himself had drunk quite a bit and wasn't sure if it was his own. He was probably a little drunk. He heard himself ask curiously, "Did you smoke today?"

"Yeah."

Liang Yiming found it amusing that Xia Sang had been nagging him to quit smoking for so long, but it turned out Xia Sang had started smoking herself.

“Didn’t you say smoking is bad for your health?” After saying that, Liang Yiming thought for a moment, then decided that smoking wasn’t a big deal. “If you want to smoke, there are plenty downstairs. Go get some yourself.”

“Thank you, Grandpa Liang,” Xia Sang said calmly, “but no need, I don’t like it.”

Liang Yiming noticed something was off about Xia Sang’s voice. Perhaps the new drug was about to be released, or perhaps he was genuinely in a good mood tonight. He became more patient and asked carefully, “Then why did you smoke today?”

“…” Xia Sang’s voice sounded a little hoarse. “The doctor said Grandma isn’t feeling well.”

Liang Yiming turned back to Xia Sang. He looked down at her reddened eyes, his mind a little muddled, unsure how to comfort her.

He wasn't familiar with Xia Sang's grandmother. After signing the contract with Xia Sang, he arranged for her to go to the hospital. He only remembered that Xia Sang was very happy right after the surgery, but one day he suddenly broke down and called him, begging him to find a doctor to save his grandmother.

By the time he arrived, Xia Sang's grandmother was already in the ICU, and when he came out, she was in a vegetative state.

Hearing this, Xia Sang seemed to cry. Liang Yiming said, "Everything will pass."

When Xia Sang woke up, he was alone in bed. He vaguely remembered crying in Liang's arms all night, not knowing what he said or when he fell asleep.

"I really shouldn't have drunk alcohol," Xia Sang lamented.

When he went downstairs, Xia Sang was still worried about seeing Liang and saying something, but Liang had already left early in the morning.

Upon arriving at the company, Xia Sang was taken to the filming location. They had already signed the contract, and today they were going to shoot the official announcement photos.

"I wonder which celebrities are involved. The director is really mysterious; we'll only find out when we get there," Xiao Hong muttered as she drove.

"It's the first test episode for a variety show; it's really hard to guess who it will be. But I'd guess it's mostly artists from Morning Star Entertainment."

Usually, for the first test episode of a variety show, if it doesn't air well, big-name celebrities won't take it. There are tons of mid-to-small-name celebrities, and the producers will invite them on a case-by-case basis, but guessing the specific individuals is still very difficult.

When they arrived at the location, it was bustling with people. The director and production team were gathered around an empty table, discussing something.

Jin Ge exclaimed, "Huo Ran and Le Mingzhi are the newly formed top idol duo, and there's also Cong Hongfei, a star who debuted through a talent show!"

This selection is excellent; all three bring their own buzz. "This variety show guest group is great, give them a good performance!"

After thinking for a moment, Jin Ge added, "It's Huo Ran, though. Be careful, he has a bad temper; he's been trending on social media for all the wrong reasons."

Xia Sang nodded. He'd seen it a few times too—things like him having a black face at an awards ceremony and disrespecting his seniors—but he didn't know if it was true.

Just then, the production crew saw them, clapped their hands, and gestured for them to come over—Xia Sang, Xiao Lin, Huo Ran & Le Mingzhi, and Cong Hongfei, all five stars were present!

Jin led them to the directing team's area, where the director, screenwriter, producer, cinematographer, and other team members were discussing something at the table.

The marketing team leader said, "Let's release the official celebrity photos first, to generate some buzz. We'll arrange the children's photos after final confirmation; after all, they're all ordinary people, so it's okay to announce them later."

A member from the marketing and advertising team added, "After the celebrity announcement, it'll be easier for us to secure some advertising sponsorships."

The producer said, "Yes, yes, and most importantly, we have 'Dawn Duo' joining this time."

The director said, "Hopefully, we can meet my KPIs this year, hahaha."

As he spoke, the director put his hand on Huo Ran's shoulder, his large belly protruding, wearing a shirt, his face shiny with oil from being exposed to the studio lights for so long.

Xia Sang watched from the sidelines and saw Huo Ran's face turn ashen, but he didn't immediately show his anger like he did online.

The director of "Internship! Dear Dad" wasn't tall, maybe just over 170cm, but he liked to put his arm around people's shoulders.

Huo Ran, at 187cm, had to bend his knees to accommodate him.

Huo Ran's teammate, Le Mingzhi, sensed his suppressed temper was about to explode.

This young master had never cooperated with anyone like this before.

After watching for a while, Huo Ran secretly felt a bit annoyed. Le Mingzhi proactively smiled and started chatting with the director, rescuing Huo Ran.

"Alright, that's enough chatting," the producer clapped his hands. "Everyone, hurry up and change your clothes to film the promotional video."

After everyone dispersed...

Le Mingzhi's manager looked around to make sure no one was approaching before stepping forward and earnestly saying, "Huo Ran, you really need to control your temper. Even if you don't like something, you can't show it."

"The reason we had you participate in this 'Dad Internship' variety show is to change the public's perception of you."

"On the show, you especially need to perform well, showing your innocent and romantic side, okay?"

Huo Ran: "..."

Le Mingzhi: "Hahahaha, so naive and romantic, such childish fools."

Le Mingzhi laughed, his gaze suddenly shifting to Xia Sang and the others walking past them. He asked curiously, "Who's that?"

The manager looked over, examined them closely, and understood, but said, "I don't know them. Don't mess with them."

Le Mingzhi raised an eyebrow. Huo Ran pursed his lips and glared at Le Mingzhi.

"You're in this dressing room." A staff member led Xia Sang and the others into the dressing room.

Xia Sang and the others happily pushed open the dressing room door and saw someone standing in his room, sitting in a chair with their back to him.

"Hello, are you the makeup artist?" Jin Fulai asked as he approached.

The man slowly turned around, a warm smile spreading across his handsome face. It was Liang Yize.

Xia Sang looked at Liang Yize's familiar smile, her fingers clenching tightly.

"Young Master Liang, what are you doing here?" Jin Ge cursed inwardly; this guy was a lunatic too.

"Why are you so nervous? The director asked me to bring you some materials." Liang Yize stood up and handed the materials to Xia Sang.

Xia Sang felt nauseous at the sight of his smile.

When she first met Liang Yize, the man was arrogant and barely spoke to her.

As he spent more time with Mr. Liang, Liang Yize began to get closer, constantly asking about Mr. Liang's affairs. He didn't readily offer any information, so he directly told Liang Yize, "Young Mr. Liang, some things are Mr. Liang's own business, and I'm not in a position to write them down. You should ask Mr. Liang yourself." Upon hearing this, Liang Yize's face turned ugly. "Who do you think you are? Just my brother's mistress, and you dare to lecture me?"

Immediately afterward, Liang Yize began to subtly and relentlessly try to trip him up, mocking and framing him…

Suddenly, Xia Sang seemed to see that scene before her eyes.

It was Xia Sang's first time attending a private party with Liang Yiming, a birthday celebration for an industry tycoon, where only celebrities were invited. Xia Sang, dressed in the formal attire prepared by Butler Liu, arrived at the banquet. Just before entering the main gate, she saw Liang Yize, who greeted her with an unusually warm smile.

Although they had had several unpleasant encounters before, Xia Sang had always been taught by her grandmother to be polite, and besides, Liang Yize had mostly been verbally sarcastic towards her.

So Xia Sang patiently suppressed her emotions and greeted him.

Unexpectedly, after the greeting, Liang Yize walked towards her. He was also dressed up that day, in a classic three-piece suit, attracting the attention of several girls passing by.

“Xia Sang, could you please take this gift to my brother?” Liang Yize handed over a gift box. “My stomach’s a little upset; could you take it upstairs for me?”

“It’s urgent. This is a gift my brother is giving to Grandpa Xu. Everyone else is giving gifts, but my brother hasn’t prepared one.” Without waiting for Xia Sang’s reply, Liang Yize shoved the gift box into her hand.

Xia Sang held the box, which felt unusually heavy. It concerned Grandpa Liang, and he couldn’t refuse. He also trusted that Liang Yize wouldn’t harm Grandpa Liang.

So he accepted the box. But Xia Sang didn’t realize that the box would become a Pandora’s box in his terrible memories. Sometimes, when he thought back on it, he even wondered if the box was really that heavy.

He took the box, clutching it tightly, and searched for Liang Yiming in the crowd.

A large crowd had gathered around the elderly Mr. Xu celebrating his birthday. He looked closely and finally spotted Mr. Liang inside, his hand being held by Mr. Xu, as they spoke.

Xia Sang, afraid of causing any trouble, quickly checked his attire to make sure it was neat and appropriate, then hurried over. As he approached, he saw that Assistant Manager Wang was also there, standing behind Mr. Liang; he had probably been too nervous to see him earlier.

Assistant Manager Wang saw him, smiled, and nodded, his eyes encouraging.

He tried to calm himself, putting on a practiced, polite smile, and walked over. He walked to Mr. Liang's side, whose expression showed some surprise, especially upon seeing the box in his hand.

Xia Sang quickly explained, "Young Master Liang said he wasn't feeling well and asked me to bring the gift over first."

Liang Yiming's expression subtly darkened. Before Mr. Liang could speak, Mr. Xu interjected, "Is this your new assistant?"

This Mr. Xu was a close friend of Mr. Liang Yiming's grandfather, having watched Liang Yiming grow up. Compared to the flattery or respect others showed to Liang Yiming, his manner was more casual and friendly.

"Is this a gift for the old man?" Mr. Xu laughed heartily. "I wonder what you prepared? I'm still trying to handle those two white jade balls you prepared last year, and I must say, my hands have become more dexterous, hahaha!"

The people around him chimed in:

"Yes, Grandpa Liang really cares about you, Grandpa Xu."

"That white jade is indeed beautiful."

"I wonder what you gave Grandpa Xu this year?"

"Grandpa Xu, show us something!"

"Yes, show us something!"

...
As they spoke, everyone's eyes turned to the jade balls in Xia Sang's hands. Xia Sang knew those gazes weren't directed at him, but his body still couldn't help but feel a burning embarrassment.

Many of these people were entrepreneurs he only saw in magazines and on television channels; now, standing among them, it felt like a dream. “Then take a look,” Liang Yiming said, taking the box and handing it to Old Master Xu. “I originally asked Yi Ze to bring this to you, but I don’t know where it went.”

Old Master Xu was a sensible man; he didn’t look down on Liang Yi Ze because of his illegitimate status. Mainly, Liang Yiming, as the head of the family, treated him like family, so outsiders had no right to criticize. “Your brother is really good. He even went abroad to study directing; only you can keep an eye on him.”

As he spoke, Old Master Xu opened the exquisite gift box. Inside was a Pixiu carved from Hetian yellow jade, about the size of a fist, with exquisite craftsmanship; every hair on the Pixiu was vividly depicted, lifelike.

It was truly a thoughtful and tasteful gift.

Well… now, a gash has appeared in the middle of one of the Pixiu's legs, a scratch marring its beautiful form and causing a sense of pity.

“Hiss—” Someone gasped sharply, and others nearby whispered amongst themselves, “How could it break?” “This is bad luck.” “…”

The tall lid of the box blocked Xia Sang's view. He couldn't see what was wrong inside, but he heard the surrounding chatter. People's eyes were now fixed on him, frowning and pointing fingers.

The dense crowd pressed down on Xia Sang, making it hard to breathe. In his eyes, everyone looked like wild beasts, ready to tear him apart. Xia Sang felt as if he had fallen into an ice cellar, his fingertips turning cold.

Xia Sang's mind was a complete mess. He struggled to control himself, but memories flooded back like a tidal wave. Every cell in his body screamed, "I didn't do it!"

He opened his mouth to explain to Liang Yiming, "Master Liang, it's not..." I...

Before he could finish, Liang Yiming glanced at him, then, without lingering, said to Old Master Xu, "It was my assistant who messed things up. I apologize to Old Master Xu."

No, I didn't fall. I was very careful with every step, afraid of making a mess of things.

Xia Sang opened his mouth to explain, but found himself at a loss for words.

Master Liang had already apologized on Xia Sang's behalf. If he denied it in front of so many people, arguing would only make the situation worse.

Xia Sang could only watch as Master Liang beckoned to Assistant Wang behind him. Assistant Wang, already standing behind Liang Yiming, cleverly produced a box and handed it to Old Master Xu.

Old Master Xu opened it, revealing a magnificent painting of the Yangtze River at sunset, a truly impressive sight.

“An old saying goes that the Pixiu (a mythical creature) has the power to ward off evil and protect the home, and this ‘碎’ (suì) also means ‘peace and safety year after year.’ Today, I’ve not only prepared this Pixiu, but also a painting by an ancient master. You love jade and painting, and I was wondering which would suit your taste. This jade ‘碎’ ensures peace, and I’m also presenting this painting to your grandfather,” Master Liang explained, bowing slightly.

As he spoke, those around him quickly offered their praise, echoing Liang Yiming's words and offering their blessings once more.

"Mr. Liang, well said!"

"Great fortune is upon you!"

"Old Master Xu is truly blessed."

Only Xia Sang stood there blankly, watching them. Seeing an opportunity, Assistant Wang pulled him out of the circle and led him to a corner.

"Mr. Xia, please rest here. We'll come find you later after the party." After instructing him, Assistant Wang quickly returned to Mr. Liang's side, glancing back as Xia Sang stood there like a dejected puppy.

After everyone had given their gifts, the glamorous people at the party continued to move about, each turn an opportunity for fame and fortune.

Xia Sang himself didn't even know how he ended up at the door.

What a coincidence! She ran into Liang Yize again. Xia Sang heard him laugh smugly, "Xia Sang, I heard that jade broke? Why didn't you check it carefully before taking it in? Well, you're just a country bumpkin, what do you know about etiquette?"

He mocked her, then picked up his wine glass and gracefully blended into the crowd to congratulate Old Master Xu.

Xia Sang turned around and watched Liang Yize skillfully clink glasses and toast with the others. She joined Liang Yize, and the two of them toasted Old Master Xu.

Inside the room, it was bustling with activity. Just a door away, the empty corridor was only occupied by the waiter who had opened the door for her.

Xia Sang felt utterly out of place.
