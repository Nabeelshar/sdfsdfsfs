Chapter 36 17 Roses (Revised)

After Jin Ge's car arrived, Xia Sang accompanied him to take Xingxing back to the orphanage. Director Li of the orphanage kept inviting him to stay for dinner, and Xingxing, with red eyes, didn't want him to leave.

"Soon, we'll see each other again, Xingxing." After comforting Xingxing with chocolate, Xia Sang left.

In the car, Jin Ge recalled the past few days' live streams and the scene just now, feeling gratified. "Xia Sang, you've really matured."

"What's wrong?" Xia Sang, her mouth full of snacks, turned to look at Jin Ge.

"..." Brother Jin, "You really shouldn't be praised."

"I've been holding back for days."

"Eat less, eat less, don't get cavities."

Brother Jin drove around the villa area to make sure no one was around before letting Xia Sang out of the car. Before leaving, he said, "Xia Sang, you were really great this time! I think I need to work even harder."

Xia Sang smiled, "Just don't work hard on my stomach."

Brother Jin glared at him, and Xia Sang laughed heartily.

After saying goodbye to Brother Jin, Xia Sang went upstairs in the villa area to put his luggage away.

The villa area was quiet. He had thought he was the only one in the villa, but when he went upstairs, he unexpectedly saw Master Liang on the bed.

He checked his phone. It wasn't the weekend, so why was he back so early?

He gently put down his luggage, leaned over the bed to look at Grandpa Liang. His eyes were tightly closed, his brow furrowed.

Asleep?

Xia Sang reached out and touched Liang Yiming's face, finding it burning hot—he had a fever!

He quickly called the housekeeper, found fever-reducing medication in the first-aid kit, and contacted the family doctor.

Everyone in the villa complex sprang into action, but they didn't wake Grandpa Liang, who was usually easily awakened.

After the family doctor determined it was just a common fever, Xia Sang stayed by Grandpa Liang's bedside, the warm yellow light of the bedside lamp shining on his nose, creating a cozy atmosphere.

Xia Sang was surprised; Grandpa Liang had actually fallen ill.

He had never seen Grandpa Liang sick in the past two years.

It seemed like Master Liang was always standing, and always incredibly tall. If you were even a little shorter, he'd have the perpetual motion machine to keep climbing.

Xia Sang admired him, but was also a victim in his own right.

Xia Sang would never forget the day Master Liang watched his acting and, with a sour face, gave him a comprehensive learning plan.

“You need to take acting classes.”

“I’m learning at the company,” Xia Sang said enthusiastically.

“You’ve learned, and you still act like this? The director might reject you? You either need to change careers or go to a training course,” Liang Yiming said.

“Then I’ll take extra lessons.”

“That teacher isn’t working for you, change to another one.”

“Okay.”

“Your lines are hurting my ears, add a vocal lesson.”

“You said last time you dropped out of high school, take an independent course.”

“…”

Muttering on and on, Xia Sang felt that Grandpa Liang was almost possessed. “Grandpa Liang, that’s enough!”

Thinking of this, Xia Sang shuddered.

In the middle of the night, Liang Yiming woke up groggily.

He opened his eyes and saw Xia Sang lying by the bed, gently patting his back, her eyes half-closed. He watched as Xia Sang yawned, lifted her eyelids, and looked at him.

She was stunned for a moment, then opened her eyes. “Grandpa Liang, are you feeling better? Do you want some water? Go to the bathroom? Eat?” "Hmm."

What do you want?

"Drink some water."

"Okay, okay." Xia Sang took the thermos and gave Grandpa Liang a few sips. After drinking, Grandpa Liang stood up.

Xia Sang, still sitting on the floor, looked at Grandpa Liang and felt that he should be completely recovered.

Grandpa Liang ate some porridge, wiped his body, took two pills, and lay back down on the bed.

He was so self-reliant that he didn't seem like a patient at all, completely losing the pitiful feeling he had just had while lying in bed.

Seeing that Grandpa Liang was really alright, Xia Sang prepared to rest when she heard Grandpa Liang say, "Come with me to the neighboring city in a couple of days." Xia Sang was confused, but he nodded honestly in agreement; after all, he didn't have much work right now.

However, this seemed to be his first time going out of town with Master Liang. Was there anything he needed to be careful about?

Xia Sang wanted to ask something, but when he turned around, he saw that Master Liang had fallen asleep again.

He reached out.

He touched his forehead; it was only slightly warm.

"It's good that you're alright."

Two days later, Xia Sang followed Liang... Yi Ming was on a business trip. Upon arrival, he learned that Master Liang had come to inspect the new drug factory. With approval granted, they had entered the production phase; the next step was promotion and sales—everything was ready to go.

That night, another clinking of glasses and a lively dinner party took place.

Several managers from a neighboring city dined with Master Liang, everyone beaming with excitement.

Before he met Master Liang, Master Liang and his team had already developed a new... The medicine had been around for several years.

While he was at the villa, he saw one of the people at the dinner table bring documents and some medicines and samples to the study to discuss things in detail with Master Liang.

What impressed him most was a silver box containing the fluids and antivenoms of several types of venomous snakes.

The key to this success lay there. Although he didn't understand the detailed explanations, he grasped the meaning of the successful development and the patients'... A one-third reduction in routine medical expenses is definitely a good thing for both oneself and the people.

Watching the people around her flattering Mr. Liang, Xia Sang began to calculate in her mind.

After a few rounds of drinks, Mr. Liang left early to return to his hotel.

No one dared to stop him. When he reached his car, the driver opened the door, and he saw a large bouquet of red roses, glistening with dew, their fragrance filling the air.

"Mr. Liang, congratulations," Xia Sang said excitedly, having drunk some wine.

Liang Yiming didn't say anything, got into the car, and Xia Sang quickly followed.

Thinking he didn't like it, Xia Sang explained, "It's too late, this is all the florist had left."

Although the flowers looked a bit tacky, it was the fastest delivery available nearby.

"Thank you." Liang Yiming picked up the bouquet.

Xia Sang nodded, accepting Liang's thanks, and then dozed off in the car. He wasn't a good drinker and had drunk too much today.

Liang Yiming looked at the drowsy Xia Sang, then at the roses in his hand.

This was probably the third time Xia Sang had given him roses.

The first time was on his birthday; then Xia Sang not only prepared roses for him but also a candlelight dinner.

What was his attitude then?

He couldn't remember.

He probably found it very strange.

He had never given roses to any of his lovers. He'd actually received roses from Xia Sang!

Valentine's Day was fast approaching after his birthday.

He was busy that day and hadn't even thought about spending Valentine's Day with Xia Sang.

By the time he finished work and returned to the villa, it was past midnight.

As soon as he opened the bedroom door, he saw a bouquet of vibrant red roses blooming on the usually empty bedside table next to the cold gray bed. Xia Sang was asleep in bed.

He glanced at them, then went to wash up. When he sat on the bed after his shower, Xia Sang looked at him with bright, sparkling eyes.

"Master Liang, you're back."

"Yes." "
"Master Liang, today is Valentine's Day..." Xia Sang seemed to realize it was past midnight, and paused. "Although it's past, I want to thank you..."

As he spoke, he saw Xia Sang's face flush slightly.

He wondered why Xia Sang would give roses as a thank you on Valentine's Day. He didn't follow Xia Sang's train of thought, but his slightly flushed face looked very endearing.

He reached out and stroked Xia Sang's cheek, kissed him, and told him, "You don't need to give these next time."

He couldn't remember at all what Xia Sang's expression had been then.

He didn't know, and he had never been curious.

But at this moment, he was a little curious.

He put down the bouquet of roses, reached out, and gently touched Xia Sang.

Xia Sang groggily opened his eyes and called out to him, "Master Liang?" "

Liang Yiming removed his gloves, revealing the gruesome scars.

He asked Xia Sang, "Are you scared?"

He saw Xia Sang shake her head.

He touched Xia Sang's face. After drinking, her face was slightly warmer than usual, and it felt pleasant to touch.

But the pain still traveled from his brain to his fingertips.

This time he paused for a moment.

*

Xia Sang felt the slightly cool temperature on her cheek, somewhat dazed.

"Master Liang, are you drunk too?" Xia Sang's mind grew increasingly muddled with drunkenness, his face nestled gently in Liang Ye's hand.

Wasn't Liang Ye supposed to hate it when people touched his hands?

In the past two years, he had seen Liang Ye's hands before. The first time he saw them, he was shocked. How could there be such serious injuries?

Back then, in a fleeting glimpse, Liang Ye had covered them up.

Now, however, Liang Ye was touching him on his own initiative. Why?

"Liang Ye..." Xia Sang began, but Liang Yiming withdrew his hand. "Are you alright?" "

Liang Ye didn't reply. After putting on his gloves, he grabbed Xia Sang's collar and kissed his lips.

He pulled Xia Sang's already confused mind into a deep daze.

The weather was clear tonight, and the stars shone brightly.

In a high-end club in City B, Xiao Lin sat in a private room. A middle-aged man leaned close to him. The man's face was somewhat weathered. He whispered in Xiao Lin's ear, "Xiao Lin, you think you can get away?"

The man reached inside Xiao Lin's clothes. "You're pretty tough, getting both me and your dad in there. Only your dad has your photos and videos? I have plenty too. Do you remember your uncle?"

"It wasn't me," Xiao Lin nervously clenched his hands. "I didn't." "

'You're being stubborn, aren't you?' the man said. 'Why are you so nervous? Didn't you hook up with Little Liang?'

'If you don't want me to cause you trouble, give me the money.' The man released Xiao Lin. Xiao Lin was quite pretty when she was young, but she'd lost that charm as she grew up. 'You should coax him nicely. Do whatever he asks you to do. And what's the name of that kid in your show's crew? Xingxing? Bring him out to play sometime.'

'Are you crazy?' Xiao Lin's eyes widened. This man wanted to kill him. Xiao Lin hadn't felt this way before; her teeth clenched like a bloody mouth ready to pounce.

'Fine, fine, I don't need you to.'" The middle-aged man knew Xiao Lin's personality well. A person with a rope around their neck can't be pulled too hard; you have to tug a little, loosen their grip, tug a little, loosen a little—that's how you trigger their survival instinct. "Give me 5 million and I'll let you go."

Xiao Lin looked at him, his eyes red. The man wasn't afraid at all; Xiao Lin was just a paper tiger.

Sure enough, Xiao Lin was quiet for a moment, then said, "I'll raise the money for you, if you dare to play me..."

Xiao Lin's meticulously applied makeup from the morning had become somewhat faded after a day, like a scratch on a carefully crafted mask.

He stood up. "I won't let you go."

"Of course," the middle-aged man laughed.
