Chapter 46 26 Missed Opportunities

As soon as the news broke, the entrance to the Liang Group was packed with people.

A security guard on duty wiped the trash off his clothes. "Damn it, I'm not the boss, why are they hitting me?"

"These people are so irrational." Another guard rubbed his face; those internet celebrities' phones had almost been shoved into his eyes.

"Stop talking, get back to work. If you get caught again today and let someone in, you'll be in big trouble."

Just then, a car pulled into the intersection, and the two men immediately stopped it.

The Liang Group's rooftop office.

Liang Yiming sat on the sofa in the reception area; his phone on the desk had been ringing off the hook.

Within an hour, news of the new drug was everywhere.

Sitting across the sofa was Ye Bin, the president of Ye's Pharmaceuticals. He held his phone, his somber expression a stark contrast to his usual frivolous demeanor. Ye Bin loved money above all else; anyone who stood in his way of making money would be destroyed.

He looked up at Liang Yiming. "Someone definitely did this on purpose. How could this news break at such a crucial moment?"

"Then, as soon as you broke the scandal, the new drug had problems, and the hospital hadn't even confirmed that the death was caused by the new drug. Sales of the new drug have been steadily increasing since its launch; it's definitely taking away someone else's profits. The worst part is, your brother actually ended up in jail." Ye Bin spread his arms, giving Liang Yiming a meaningful look. "What are you up to?" "If you're just here gossiping and don't want to make money, get back to your company." Master Liang grabbed his coat and began instructing his assistant, "Suspend all medications. First, we must ensure the patient's safety. Second, have the lab coordinate with the hospital to find the cause as quickly as possible."

Liang Yiming pointed to Ye Bin, the main manager of the research and development team, "Finally, you and I will go to X City now."

"Okay." Ye Bin stood up as well.

"Don't cause trouble there." Liang Yiming reminded him.

"I'm not the kind of person who can't control myself. Even chasing girls requires me to be in a good mood." Ye Bin opened the door and laughed, "You, on the other hand, look like you're the one who's sexually frustrated." "

Liang Yiming's face darkened instantly upon hearing this.

He disliked being defined like that.

"Go back, I'll go myself."

"Go? Liang Yiming, are you that stingy?" Ye Bin said speechlessly.

After finally getting through the Liang Group's layers of security, Brother Jin drove his car into the Liang Group's underground garage. Jin Fulai wiped non-existent sweat from his forehead, "This inspection process really made me feel like I was in some high-security institution. Luckily, you gave me a pass earlier."

Xia Sang stood in the parking lot elevator lobby, waiting for the elevator to descend, "Brother Jin, what do you think I should say to Master Liang?" Once inside the group's headquarters, Xia Sang finally realized how impulsive she had been.

Unable to get through to Mr. Liang or Secretary Wang, she rushed to Mr. Liang's company. What could he possibly do?

"...You don't need to ask me about these kinds of ambiguous little things between lovers," Jin Fulai said, noticing Xia Sang nervously fidgeting with her fingers. "I suggest a whole package of kissing, hugging, and crying."

Xia Sang imagined the scene. "It's a bit disgusting, Brother Jin."

"You know that's good. I'm a staunch believer in remaining single and not getting married. I suggest you don't ask me." Jin Fulai smoothed his hair and clothes in front of the elevator's reflective strip.

"I just wanted to check on things," Xia Sang said.

"Then say whatever you want." "Jin Fulai said casually.

Say whatever you want. Xia Sang silently thought to herself.

Say whatever you want—it's so easy to say, but so hard to do.

The few minutes in the elevator seemed to stretch on forever. Xia Sang made up her mind to go out.

When she reached the office door, she found that Mr. Liang was no longer there.

Secretary Xiao Zhang said apologetically, "Mr. Xia, Mr. Liang and my boss have already left for X City."

Did she miss him?

Xia Sang came out, and Jin Fulai was waiting for him at the elevator door. Seeing him come out so quickly, "Did you see Mr. Liang?"

Xia Sang shook her head. "Mr. Liang took the next flight to X City."

"X City, the hospital where the accident happened?" Xia Sang nodded.

Xia Sang looked at Jin Fulai, who sighed upon receiving her gaze. "You want to go see Master Liang? I don't know if I should advise you against it; it's not good for you if someone sees you."

"I know," Xia Sang replied,

but he just wanted to see Master Liang, even though he knew there was nothing he could do.

At least seeing Master Liang would put his mind at ease.

Jin Fulai sighed again. "Then get in the car quickly, check the flights, maybe if we go now we can still see him." "

After a frantic drive, Xia Sang and Jin Fulai finally arrived at the airport, but before they could even find the specific flight's entrance or exit, Jin had already spotted a large number of paparazzi and reporters.

He quickly told Xia Sang to put on her disguise and follow the paparazzi and reporters. Sure enough, they spotted Mr. Liang and his secretary, Mr. Wang, in the distance, along with Mr. Ye, whom they seemed to have met once or twice before.

They were surrounded by paparazzi and reporters, but Mr. Liang's bodyguards and VIP privileges prevented them from getting close.

Xia Sang resisted the urge to approach, watching from afar. It was too far; he couldn't make out Liang Yiming's appearance, but he still looked so tall and imposing.

It seemed as if the distance between them would always be so vast.

"It's best not to cause trouble." “Xia Sang murmured.

“Do you want to buy a ticket and go in?” Jin Fulai didn’t hear Xia Sang’s words. “But you should be prepared, even if you go in, you probably won’t get close.”

Xia Sang was about to reply when her phone rang. It was a call from Director Liu of the orphanage.

“Mr. Xia, it’s like this, there’s something I might need to trouble you with.”

Xia Sang rushed to the orphanage, where Director Liu somewhat apologetically led Xingxing over.

The orphanage’s door had been blocked for several days, and some paparazzi had even pretended to be adoptive parents to try and get information out of Xingxing.

This was just a small orphanage, and the disturbance was truly unbearable.

Director Liu explained the situation to Xia Sang, “We really have no other choice but to ask you for help.” "

Dean Liu patted Xingxing's head. "We don't want Xingxing to be sad either; after all, he was a victim in what happened before."

Xia Sang looked at Xingxing, who had fully recovered both mentally and physically. She hadn't expected those paparazzi to target even children; Xingxing was the most innocent one.

"Hello, Brother Xia Sang," Xingxing said happily, looking at Xia Sang.

Xia Sang assured Dean Liu, "Don't worry, we'll take good care of him." "

Then, he helped Xingxing pack some clothes and carried her out. They had wanted to be discreet, but the area around the orphanage was too open; there was nowhere to hide.

When Xia Sang went in, some paparazzi hadn't noticed her, but now that they saw her come out, they rushed forward to ask questions—about Grandpa Liang, about Xiao Lin. Xia Sang and Jin Fulai all replied, 'I don't know,' 'Wait for further notice.'

Until a reporter asked, 'Teacher Xia, is Xingxing your illegitimate child?'

Xia Sang was stunned, her face showing a look of utter disbelief. 'Are you really allowed to spread such rumors?'

A group of colleagues around her suddenly realized, 'You can spread rumors like that!'" He gave a look that said, "..."

Xingxing opened his eyes wide and looked at the uncle. How did his brother become his father?

He blinked and said seriously, "No, Xia Sang is my brother."

This really made Xia Sang laugh.
