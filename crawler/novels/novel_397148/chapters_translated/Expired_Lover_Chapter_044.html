Chapter 68, Meeting 43

Upon arriving at Xiao Hong's house, Xia Sang met Yuan Ziyi, Jin Fulai's newly recruited artist. Yuan Ziyi was a handsome, somewhat shy boy.

"Although Xiao Ziyi isn't the most handsome, his acting talent is top-notch. Fans call it 'face-changing acting'," Jin Fulai said, his voice slightly slurred from drinking.

"..." Xia Sang smiled helplessly, "Brother Jin, just say you don't like me."

Everyone burst into laughter.

The gathering lasted until late into the night, and Xiao Hong and Yuan Ziyi were both drunk.

Only Jin Fulai and Xia Sang remained, standing on the balcony, sipping beer intermittently.

After a long pause, Jin lit a cigarette before speaking, "Xiaxia, what are your thoughts on coming back this time?"

Xia Sang took the cigarette from Jin Fulai but didn't light it. "Just came back to visit."

Jin Fulai took a few deep drags and stubbed the cigarette out in the soil of the flowerpot. "Xiaxia, tsk, about you and Grandpa Liang, I... I don't know... how to say it, but I want you to know. No matter what Grandpa Liang does, you have no responsibility. You can make your own choices."

Jin Fulai wanted to know what Xia Sang was thinking.

Xia Sang, cigarette in hand, watched the few people scattering along the neighborhood streets. "Brother Jin," she said, "where would I be now if it weren't for Grandpa Liang?

Grandma would have died three years ago, I wouldn't be in school, and without Grandpa Liang, I wouldn't have so much money to help everyone…

Grandpa Liang is my benefactor."

Xia Sang turned to look at Jin Fulai's face; his appearance had changed slightly. "If Grandpa Liang really needed me, how could I not help…

I can't just remember the bad things people do and forget the good they do."

Xia Sang had grown up with her grandmother, a child and an old woman alike. Xia Sang couldn't even remember how many grievances her grandmother had suffered, how many times she had secretly shed tears.

No one owes anyone anything.

Choosing to be his lover was his own choice.

It was all his own choice, so he couldn't complain, nor could he regret it.

Only by having no regrets can you keep looking forward.

Only then will you avoid being dragged into darkness by unattainable things and delusions, unable to escape.

Jin Fulai sighed heavily, his flesh trembling. "I really can't do anything with you, but let me tell you, you'd better be careful when you see Master Liang tomorrow."

Xia Sang tilted her head in confusion. Jin Fulai took a sip of his drink. "Master Liang might have some psychological problems. I saw a psychologist go to see him with that General Manager Wang."

Jin Fulai had met Qin Lang; a female star in the company had serious psychological issues and sought treatment from Qin Lang. "An artist was sick before and also went to him. Who knows what Master Liang is like now."

Since Liang Yiming's incident, he has appeared less and less in public.

"I wonder how serious it is..." Jin Fulai suddenly remembered something, turned to look at Xia Sang, and asked the same question from years ago, "Wasn't Master Liang sick before? Did he really not have any unusual fetishes?"

This question startled Xia Sang, who couldn't help but chuckle. Why did Brother Jin still remember this?

"What are you laughing at?" Jin Fulai slapped Xia Sang on the head. "You're not hiding anything from me, are you?"

"No," Xia Sang replied, "Really not."

"Then it must be an eye problem this year. Anyway, be careful." Jin Fulai took another sip of his drink, and Xia Sang agreed.

Jin Fulai drank a few more sips of wine, still feeling uneasy. This was a mess; that Master Liang was definitely something wrong with him.

Jin Fulai, glaring at Xia Sang's face, felt a surge of anger. He raised his hand, but Xia Sang noticed and immediately covered her head. Just as she was about to smile, Jin Fulai grabbed her ear and twisted it. "You think you're so cool, so awesome? Damn it, you're driving me crazy!" But he was also incredibly worried. "You're really stupid," Jin Fulai said, still fuming.

"Brother Jin, it hurts, it hurts! But we still have you guys here."

"Get out, get out, don't let me see you now."

Xia Sang was kicked off the balcony by the irritable Jin Fulai. Seeing Brother Jin still smoking on the balcony, she cautioned, "Brother Jin, don't smoke so much."

Jin Fulai again told her to get out, and she was pushed back inside.

Back in her bedroom, Xia Sang lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling, and murmured softly, "Liang Yiming." She couldn't imagine what their meeting would be like tomorrow.

The next day, Jin Fulai drove Xia Sang and her group to the villa halfway up the mountain. Secretary Wang greeted them upon arrival.

Robbs had been out of danger some time ago and was now recuperating at the villa. Upon entering, Xia Sang and her group saw Robles' nearly hundred-foot-long, transparent glass-enclosed doghouse filled with medical equipment, and a nurse was there with him.

Xiao Hong couldn't help but exclaim, "I know I shouldn't say this, but I really do feel a bit resentful of the rich. This treatment is better than mine. When I'm sick, I can only wait for Brother Jin to have a change of heart and empty my bedpan."

Jin Fulai couldn't resist slapping Xiao Hong on the back.

But as everyone approached, they saw Robles' appearance on the table—his once-muscular physique and beautiful coat were gone, especially his abdomen, which was shaved bald. The rest of his fur was uneven, patchy with new down, and he lay there with his eyes closed, receiving an IV drip.

Secretary Wang explained that some of the fur had been surgically removed, while some had fallen out due to toxins irritating the dog's skin.

Xia Sang almost didn't recognize him; how painful that must have been.

Xia Sang's eyes instantly reddened. She leaned close to the glass window and whispered, "Radish."

Perhaps it was a coincidence, or perhaps a premonition.

So softly, Robles, who had been lying face down with its eyes closed, suddenly raised its head. Its brown eyes seemed to light up instantly, locking onto Xia Sang's figure outside the glass window. It excitedly tried to stand up, tugging at the IV tube. Blood flowed back into the tube, and the medical staff inside quickly held it down.

It struggled towards Xia Sang, trying to pounce!

A short, urgent, and aggrieved whimper escaped its throat.

"Radish! Radish! Don't move, don't move!" Xia Sang's heart pounded. He pressed his palm tightly against the glass, trying to soothe it. "I'm here!"

Xiao Hong's eyes also reddened; he couldn't bear to see this.

Jin Fulai couldn't help but sigh; some feelings remain even across time. As the medical staff inside opened the door and invited Xia Sang and the others in, Xia Sang stroked Robles, tears streaming down her face.

"Robbles, I'm here. What happened to you?"

Xia Sang tried her best to comfort Robles, but Robles was still very agitated, though he seemed happy.

The medical staff nearby also remarked that this was the happiest Robles had appeared in a while.

Finally, to avoid agitating the dog and affecting its recovery, Xia Sang and the others decided to leave after a short visit.

"Sweetie, I'll come see you again later," Xia Sang said, stroking Robles' head.

Emerging from the villa, Secretary Wang led Xia Sang and the others inside. Xia Sang unconsciously swallowed, her palms slightly sweaty.

Secretary Wang led Xiao Hong and Brother Jin to the living room. "Tea and refreshments have been prepared for Mr. Jin and Mr. Hao. Mr. Xia is alone with Master Liang."

Jin Fulai and Xiao Hong looked at Xia Sang with concern, but Xia Sang gave them a reassuring look. He could handle it.

As Xia Sang followed Secretary Wang through the villa, step by step, up to the master bedroom,

Xia Sang realized that the memory was still vivid. Wasn't this villa supposed to be emptied and about to be sold? Why had Master Liang moved back?

Xia Sang was puzzled. He carefully observed the decorations and furnishings of the villa. It was the same as before, except now the tables and chairs were covered with protective foam, presumably to accommodate Grandpa Liang.

“Secretary Wang, did you just move back?” Xia Sang asked softly. “I remember this place being emptied before.”

“No, we moved back a year ago.”

So Grandpa Liang moved back shortly after he went blind.

“Why?” Xia Sang pressed.

“Grandpa Liang still prefers to live here,” Secretary Wang explained.

What did that mean? Xia Sang didn't have time to ask.

Looking up, he saw the master bedroom door. Secretary Wang said, “We've arrived, Mr. Xia,” and gently knocked on the door.

Xia Sang's heart pounded, his mind racing with unpredictable thoughts of what Master Liang looked like.

What would Master Liang's reaction be when he saw him? He should know he was here, right?

A series of silly questions flooded Xia Sang's mind.

His palms were sweating.

A voice inside said "Come in," and Secretary Wang pressed the doorknob—click—

The door opened.

Xia Sang saw Master Liang sitting on the sofa in the small living room. His eyes were closed, and his hands, unlike before, weren't outstretched on the sofa back; they were clenched tightly. He sat there upright, his back ramrod straight.

Xia Sang felt a lump in his throat; he didn't even know what to say first.

Liang Yiming spoke first, saying, "Xia Sang, you didn't need to come."
