Chapter 77, Market 52

"Sister Juan, are Xia Sang and the others coming back today?" Chen Anyang peered over. The sun was almost setting, but he still hadn't seen Xia Sang.

"Xia didn't need my permission to go out; he's just a volunteer." After helping Liang Yiming find Dr. Xue that day, Xu Juan went back to Xingwang Village to take care of some business. Three days had passed since then, and according to Xia Sang, they should be back today. "What's wrong? Do you miss Xia?"

"I...I was just checking on the tenants," Chen Anyang said.

Xu Juan, who was writing in her work journal at the table, heard this and looked up, saying cryptically, "An Yang, you're an only child."

"I..." Chen An Yang hadn't finished speaking when Xia Sang came in carrying several bags of fruit. "Sister Juan, An Yang, you're all here."

Xia Sang placed the fruit on the table. "We're back." Then, Liang Yiming and his group came in and greeted them.

"How are your eyes?" Xu Juan asked with concern.

"Dr. Xue said it will take time, but it can be treated," Xia Sang replied. She knew best how well Liang Yiming had been taking care of him these past few days.

"That's good."

"Okay, then I'll go back now and come help again tomorrow."

"Okay." Xu Juan stood up and saw Xia Sang and the others to the door. Seeing Chen Anyang, who had been hiding to one side, approach, Xu Juan clearly wanted to follow, but after taking a step, he stopped at the doorway and didn't go over.

"Why aren't you going back?" Xu Juan asked.

"Never mind, it seems inconvenient with so many people around."

Xu Juan smiled upon hearing this and went back to continue writing her work diary, while Chen Anyang felt a heaviness creeping into his heart.

After dinner, Xia Sang suggested that Master Liang could come out for a walk in the yard to digest his food.

Liang Yiming didn't object; he stood in the yard and called to Butler Liu.

"Sir, what is it?"

"Did you bring my cane?" Liang Yiming asked Butler Liu.

"Yes, yes!" Butler Liu replied excitedly.

"Bring it here."

Xia Sang, who had overheard, rushed into the house and brought out the item. He asked Grandpa Liang, "Grandpa Liang, are you going to practice with a cane?"

"Yes."

Xia Sang wanted to ask more, but was afraid of saying too much and making Grandpa Liang overthink. She silently smiled at Butler Liu. Grandpa Liang was going to use his cane!

Liang Yiming tested the ground with his cane, standing up from his wheelchair. The cane in his hand was like a scepter, making him appear tall and imposing.

Then he gently tapped the ground with the cane, slowly taking small steps. He seemed still a bit clumsy, but it was a good start.

Qin Lang sat on the swing in the yard, smiling behind his gold-rimmed glasses.

Oh dear, I don't know who said he didn't need anyone to take care of him.

It's only been a few days, and he's already using a cane.

Summer in the mountains is hot during the day, but cool at night.

After washing up, Xia Sang shook out the covers and snuggled comfortably into the folding bed in Liang Yiming's room. Xia Sang had this advantage: she could sleep anywhere.

The little mongrel, however, had long since been chased away by Grandpa Liang.

"Grandpa Liang, there's a market in the village tomorrow. Do you want to go?" They had been back for a few days, and tomorrow was Sunday, market day in the village. Xia Sang wanted to take Grandpa Liang out for a walk.

"The market?" Liang Yiming was also lying in bed.

“Because the village is small and there aren’t many goods, some people regularly bring goods over to sell because they can’t buy them in the village. The surplus produce from each household in the village is also bought by others.” Xia Sang habitually spoke to the other person. He had been lying flat, but as he spoke, he naturally turned over and looked up to see Liang Yiming’s face, directly in his direction.

Did Grandpa Liang used to like sleeping on his left side? Xia Sang wondered.

“Okay.” Xia Sang saw Liang Yiming move his lips.

Xia Sang noticed that the moon seemed particularly bright here. The moonlight spilling in from the window behind him stretched his shadow onto the bed, making Grandpa Liang’s face clearly visible.

Xia Sang watched quietly. "Okay, goodnight, Grandpa Liang."

"Goodnight."

The village market was more bustling than Liang Yiming had imagined.

It was packed with people early on. Liang Yiming didn't want Xia Sang to help him; he was using his cane, and with every step he took, he bumped into someone. Suddenly, in a jostling motion, Xia Sang was accidentally pushed aside from Liang Yiming.

As if sensing something, Liang Yiming called out, "Xia Sang," the instant she was pushed aside.

Xia Sang was a little dazed from the impact and hadn't spoken yet.

A loud "bang" was heard.

Someone grabbed Liang Yiming's arm.

Liang Yiming forcefully shoved the other man aside, but before he could even utter a word, the other man preemptively shouted, "Hey, you! You smashed my antique vase!"

Xia Sang, who had just been jostled aside, rushed back and anxiously looked at Grandpa Liang. "Grandpa Liang, are you alright?"

"I'm fine," Liang Yiming shook his head.

“He’s fine, but I’m not.” A middle-aged man, dressed in a gray vest and black shorts, with a fleshy face and thick lips, rushed over. He stood at a small stall; several bottles and bowls were laid out on a simple gray cloth, with a sign that read “Recycling Old Items.” “He broke my antique vase.”

Although there were many people around, Liang Yiming was certain he hadn’t hit anything hard like a table, and his force wasn’t great; it was impossible for the vase to fall off the table with just one tap.

“I didn’t,” Liang Yiming said.

"You say you didn't, so you don't!" The middle-aged man, hands on his hips, pointed at Liang Yiming. "You didn't bump into me, so how did this bottle fall?"

"I didn't even touch your table."

"You couldn't even see it? You say you didn't bump into me, so you don't? Isn't that just being a deadbeat?!"

Xia Sang had never seen the middle-aged man in the village before. "Uncle, are you from another village?"

"Yes, so what? Your village is going to bully people from other villages?" "Are you even human?!" The middle-aged man immediately changed his tune. "Hey everyone, look at this! These outsiders are being bullied while doing business here. These young lads look decent enough, but they do nothing right!"

Liang Yiming was amused by the man's tantrum. "So what do you want?"

"I'll pay you back, three thousand yuan."

"Pfft—" This time Liang Yiming laughed out loud. All this for just three thousand yuan.

"What are you laughing at?" The middle-aged man pointed at Liang Yiming.

Xia Sang quickly stood in front of Liang Yiming and asked, looking down at him, "Master Liang, are you sure you didn't bump into anything?"

"Yes."

Hearing Liang Yiming's answer, Xia Sang immediately slapped the middle-aged man's hand away. "I believe my friend. He said no, so it's definitely not true. Did you accidentally fall?"

"Can you believe what a blind man says? He can't even see!"

Liang Yiming's anger flared up. He glared coldly at the man from behind Xia Sang.

The man felt a strange, uncomfortable feeling as he looked at Liang Yiming's unfocused eyes staring at him.

"I didn't say anything wrong!"

Liang Yiming hated it when people talked about his eyes.

Just as he was about to reply, Xia Sang, holding the shards of the vase he had just picked up while squatting down, said, "Please, if you're going to scam someone, at least spend some money! Look at this writing! How much did you buy this vase for? At most a few dozen yuan, and you dare ask for three thousand?"

"You…you're interfering with me! I'm selling things, and I set the price!" The middle-aged man looked somewhat annoyed and angry.

"Then you're not just lying, you're swindling!"

"Bullshit!" The middle-aged man was about to retort when a person squeezed through the crowd. Wearing a white T-shirt and shorts, it was Chen Anyang. He happened to be passing by, heard the argument, and upon closer inspection, recognized Xia Sang. He quickly asked, "Brother Xia, what's wrong?"

"This person is lying."

"I'm not!"

"You're claiming something worth tens of dollars is worth thousands. What else is that but lying?"

"Chen Anyang, call the police. Have your second uncle at the police station arrest him." Chen Anyang was taken aback. Where did he get a second uncle at the police station? He was puzzled, but still cooperated for Xia Sang, agreeing.

“You’re abusing your power!” The middle-aged man was still struggling. Xia Sang pointed to the second floor across the street, then turned and winked at Chen Anyang. “That’s Anyang’s aunt’s house. See that black thing? That’s the surveillance camera.”

“Yes, I installed it for her a few days ago. It’s right there. That thing is super high-definition; it’ll definitely capture it.” Chen Anyang almost laughed out loud. Well, now he had an aunt too.

“Anyang, you stay with this old man. I’ll go get the surveillance footage right now. If we hit him, we’ll pay you every penny, plus a few hundred extra as compensation. If not, take him to the police station immediately. Watch him, don’t let him get away.” Xia Sang mimicked the middle-aged man’s earlier menacing tone.

Seeing Xia Sang really about to go over, the middle-aged man panicked and cursed, "You...you're all crazy!" He abandoned his stall and ran away in a flash.

This amused Xia Sang and Chen Anyang, who burst into laughter.

Liang Yiming stood behind, listening intently to Xia Sang's voice.

He listened to Xia Sang defending him, each word clear and logical.

He had only said one thing: he hadn't. And Xia Sang had protected him so fiercely.

"Xia Sang, you believed me when I said I didn't?" Liang Yiming asked.

Seeing the man run away, Xia Sang quickly turned back to support Liang Yiming. He hadn't managed to catch him before when someone pushed him aside; this time, he was better off holding on tighter.

“You said no, of course not, Mr. Liang, you don’t need to lie like that.” Xia Sang supported Liang Yiming, who didn’t pull his arm away. Xia Sang continued, “Besides, I brought you out, so of course I have to protect you.”

Liang Yiming froze when he heard this. He couldn’t see her now; he didn’t know what Xia Sang’s expression was like standing in front of him. He imagined it, and suddenly remembered Xia Sang’s appearance after that banquet.

At this moment, Liang Yiming seemed to finally understand Xia Sang’s expression back then.

Panic. Fear. Disappointment.

In his memory, he only thought it was a small matter at the time. Anyway, it was already resolved. As long as the problem was solved, why take it so seriously? Now it seems there was more to it than that; perhaps there were other things he should have done back then.

For example, trust. Liang Yiming frowned, feeling the slightly heavier breathing and his heart racing. A strange emotion welled up inside him, making him feel a lump in his throat and choke back tears.
