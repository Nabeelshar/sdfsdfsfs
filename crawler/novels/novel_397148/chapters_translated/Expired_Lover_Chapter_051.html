Chapter 75, Part 50: Xu Juan

Xia Sang saw Xu Juan standing at the door and quickly waved.

Xu Juan had returned two days early. She wore a red T-shirt and black pants, was well-built, and her wheat-colored skin made her look energetic and vibrant.

“I brought you some delicious food, Xia, come and try some!” Xu Juan greeted Xia Sang with a smile.

Xia Sang pushed Liang Yiming and hurried over.

Xu Juan looked closely and didn't recognize the man.

“Xia, who is this?”

“My former boss, also a friend of mine, his surname is Liang,” Xia Sang explained.

"Is there something wrong with your leg?"

"No..." Xia Sang wanted to say something, but then thought of Master Liang, opened her mouth and closed it again, unsure how to phrase it. Xia Sang winked at Xu Juan, "Sister Juan, don't ask!"

At this moment, Liang Yiming spoke directly, "It's an eye problem."

"Oh, oh." Xu Juan smiled, "Look at my personality. Come on in, everyone."

Xia Sang pushed him along, anxiously watching Liang Yiming's expression. Seeing that Liang Yiming was as usual, he finally relaxed.

"Xia, I think your account is doing quite well."

"It's all thanks to Xiao Hong and An Yang." Xia Sang said shyly. "An Yang sacrificed a lot."

"Okay, I'll arrange a reward for you guys later, hahaha." Xu Juan laughed heartily. Putting everything else aside, Chen Anyang's videos had been the subject of much ridicule from his college friends.

Xia Sang and Xu Juan chatted for a while, their laughter creating a relaxed atmosphere. Liang Yiming, listening nearby, clenched his fists tightly.

After pushing Liang Yiming inside, Xia Sang was called away. She slipped a pastry into Liang Yiming's hand, saying, "Grandpa Liang, this is delicious. I'll go check it out. Sister Juan, I'll go now. You can go do what you need to do; Grandpa Liang knows this place well."

Xia Sang had initially wanted to ask Sister Juan to watch over Grandpa Liang, but fearing it might upset him, he resisted the urge to do so.

Seeing Liang Yiming nod, Xia Sang left his side. Their interactions at the office had been like this for some time now.

Xu Juan didn't leave after Xia Sang departed; she stood there with Liang Yiming. Liang Yiming, not hearing Xu Juan's footsteps, suddenly asked, "Miss Xu, how did you two meet?"

Xu Juan paused for a moment before realizing Liang Yiming was referring to her and Xia Sang.

"Um… Mr. Liang, right?" Xu Juan recalled Xia Sang's introduction and looked at him strangely when he asked about her and Xia Sang. "Xia didn't mention it to you?"

Liang Yiming shook his head slightly.

“It's by the river at the edge of the village,” Xu Juan said with a smile. She recalled the first time she saw Xia Sang. She had just returned from running errands in the city when she saw a child crying for help in the river and jumped in to save him.

When she pulled the child out, several children on the bank cheered and jumped for joy. But next to the group of children, a handsome little boy she didn't recognize was crying, his eyes red as he looked at her, repeatedly saying it was alright.

That was the first time Xu Juan saw Xia Sang.

She thought at the time, "What a handsome boy; even his crying is heartbreaking."

Later, at the errand office, she learned that Xia Sang was an adopted son from a family in the village who had returned to his adoptive parents' home.

The two initially had little interaction, but perhaps it was fate. During her daily outings, she often bumped into this young man. He would often steal glances at her, and if his dark eyes hadn't been completely devoid of affection, she would have misunderstood. Later, when he learned she was involved in e-commerce poverty alleviation, he volunteered to help and even donated money.

“Xia, you’re such a good person,” Xu Juan said with admiration. Then, she looked at Liang Yiming’s eyes and asked, “By the way, what’s wrong with your eyes? Are they congenital or acquired?”

Liang Yiming was silent for a moment before slowly answering, “Acquired.”

Xu Juan glanced at Liang Yiming and continued, “I went to a meeting in the city this time, and I heard there’s a barefoot doctor in the mountains a few miles away who’s very skilled, specializing in treating difficult and complicated illnesses. If you trust him, you can give him a try.”

Xu Juan hesitated slightly after speaking. From Liang Yiming’s clothes and wheelchair, she knew he was definitely from a wealthy family, but the richer people are, the more problems they often have.

When Xia Sang returned after helping out, she heard Xu Juan say, "A doctor? Sister Juan, what kind of doctor? Can he cure something like Master Liang's?"

"Well... I can't guarantee it, but I've heard he's very effective. I don't think Mr. Liang is an ordinary person; he's probably already looked everywhere for doctors. Why don't we go and see him?"

"Okay, okay!" Xia Sang smiled happily at Liang Yiming, then remembered that Master Liang was blind. "Master Liang, let's go see him. Maybe we'll have a chance?"

"Then how do we get to him?" Xia Sang asked.

Xu Juan checked her phone; tomorrow was the 15th. "I heard he regularly goes down the mountain for free clinics in the middle of the month. Tomorrow is his day."

"Then let's go tomorrow!"

The warm breath on his face made Liang Yiming frown slightly.

To be honest, he had consulted countless doctors, and even those experts couldn't cure him.

Relying on an unknown barefoot doctor in a remote mountain village was unwise.

At least it lacked basis. He needed to understand the situation thoroughly before making a decision.

Before he could speak, Xia Sang started chattering again.

"Grandpa Liang, let's go see him! Let's go see him!"

In an instant, this disrupted Liang Yiming's thoughts, and he nodded as if possessed.

"That's wonderful," Xia Sang thought. If Grandpa Liang's eyes were cured, he could return to his world, and he would repay Grandpa Liang's kindness.

Xia Sang shook her head happily.

The next day, Butler Liu drove everyone to the neighboring town. Upon arriving at the neighboring town, they were told that the other person hadn't come down the mountain.

"Then how do we find him?" Xia Sang and her group asked a resident.

"If you're in a hurry, you can go directly up the mountain to find him. It's been raining these past two days, and Dr. Xue is probably tending to his herbs. It's easy to get up the mountain; just follow the path upwards." The resident pointed in the direction of the mountain. "If you're not in a rush, you can come back in a few days when the weather clears up."

Xu Juan was an honest person. She had brought the person here but hadn't seen him, so she felt a little embarrassed. "Should we go straight up? Or should I ask around next time and then..."

Xia Sang looked at Liang Yiming. She had come here for Grandpa Liang's sake; this matter depended on his arrangements.

Liang Yiming remained silent, his lips pressed tightly together. Soon, he nodded slightly and said, "Go."

Now that he was here, there was no reason to turn back.

It was just going up a mountain, not like he was being boiled alive.

"Then, young man, could you please lead the way and accompany us up the mountain?" Butler Liu, who had been silently standing at the back, stepped forward and invited one of the strong young men. "We can offer a fee."

The young man grinned and readily agreed. Xu Juan watched Butler Liu transfer money, and couldn't help but think that Xia Sang, the boss, was indeed wealthy. She then saw Xia Sang talking to Liang Yiming with her head down, and felt a slightly different feeling about their relationship.

At the beginning of the mountain path, the wheelchair could still be pushed, but the road gradually became rugged, with numerous stone steps, especially slippery from the rain.

While a few able-bodied people were fine, the wheelchair became a complete burden.

"Master Liang, the wheelchair can't go this way," Xia Sang said worriedly.

Liang Yiming sat in the wheelchair, his face grim.

But he had said he would come, and his illness needed treatment.

He stood up, surrounded by the chirping of birds and the rustling of fallen leaves.

Xia Sang quickly helped Liang Yiming.

The mountain path had been slippery due to the rain these past few days, and in the unfamiliar environment, Liang Yiming slipped on his first step.

Although Xia Sang pulled him back from the ground, a hint of distress and anger appeared on Liang Yiming's face, and his breathing was heavy.

His hands clenched tightly; this wasn't the first time Liang Yiming had fallen outside.

After his eyesight was impaired, Liang Yiming initially went to work normally, but things he used to do easily now required assistance, and he needed 24-hour care.

He needed someone to guide him, someone to read documents aloud, and someone to place water in a specific location… It was as if he couldn't take care of himself. But Liang Yiming had been learning how to live. Now that things had come to this, he could only learn to accept it; anything can be resolved if accepted.

At the company, he used a cane to walk to his top-floor office, and even when he heard some whispers, Liang Yiming stood ramrod straight.

But losing his sight was far from easy.

Even the general secretary and his secretariat sometimes couldn't provide adequate support, and there were always those who wanted to climb the social ladder.

With his eyesight gone, even if documents were tampered with, no one noticed in time. Every day, people would come and go, and someone would always find a chance to replace a contract with one that only had a few numbers changed.

Once it was signed, even if the person responsible had been found and the document was signed, the loss was irreversible. The amount wasn't large, but the loss of face was.

"Nephew, I told you, you have eye problems now, so just rest," Liang Jinfeng said, walking into his office and drinking tea.

"It was just an accident," Liang Yiming replied coldly.

"An accident?" Liang Jinfeng chuckled. "Then, nephew, are you planning to add a few more people to guard against such accidents?"

Liang Yiming remained silent, his face cold.

"I'm afraid I won't skimp," Liang Jinfeng said, taking a sip of hot tea. "What do you think of me? I'm family, and I have shares. It's a good deal."

"Get out."

"Alright, alright, nephew, then you must be careful, watch out for accidents." Liang Jinfeng finished speaking and left.

After that day, Liang Jinfeng didn't show up in front of him for several days. He was only heard to be treating the board members to meals and drinks.

Liang Yiming smoked in his office. He knew these people were opportunists, only caring about money. Some of them already harbored resentment over the last mistake.

Since he was blind, he should rest in peace.

But Liang Yiming was dismissive.

Then the same thing happened a second time. Although Secretary Wang stopped him this time, preventing any loss, some people started gossiping and praising Liang Jinfeng.

Indeed, people's hearts are fickle.

Then, during a new collaboration, Liang Yiming needed to visit the other company. At the company's entrance, while walking, he tripped and fell.

He fell in front of everyone.

The fall was quite severe. Having lost his sight, the pain was excruciating, and without his vision, he didn't even know how to react.

Liang Yiming was stunned for a moment.

The sounds around him were chaotic.

The pain in his knees and the arms pulling at him told him that he was no longer capable; he was different from before.

…
