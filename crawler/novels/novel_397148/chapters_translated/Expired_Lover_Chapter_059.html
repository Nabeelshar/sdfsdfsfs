<h1>◇ Chapter 82 Winning the Award</h1>

Chapter 82 Award

Two years later, at the F Country International Documentary Film Festival, among many international blockbusters, a domestic documentary broke through the competition, its title being—"Spring Breeze."

When the news reached China, netizens rejoiced, speculating online about who the director was.

1st Floor: Wow, amazing!

2nd Floor: The beginning for China!

3rd Floor: Documentaries will finally have a place!!

4th Floor: 666, who made it? Director Luo? Director Luo?

Everyone was speculating about the person, but no major companies or directors claimed responsibility until the festival's live broadcast began, when the name was finally revealed in the list of nominees.

: What's his name? What's his name?

: That person looks like a celebrity who retired from the entertainment industry a few years ago.

: Xia something, I didn't see clearly.

: Xia Sang!!!

: Is that Xia Sang from two years ago, the one who was rumored to be a kept woman?

: Wasn't she supposed to be a dog owner?

: Holy crap, that's amazing, taking selfies all by herself.

: I believe whatever you say, she must be a sugar daddy, acting like she's going to receive an award, money makes all the difference.

: I don't care, if she can win, that's awesome!!

...

While domestic netizens were arguing online, far away at the awards ceremony in F country, Xiao Hong was also engaging in a live online debate with netizens who were criticizing Xia Sang, "I'm so angry! What kind of proxy photographers are they? They just spout nonsense!"

"Oh well, never mind," Jin Fulai said, pulling in his stomach to loosen the buttons on his shirt. "It's Xia Sang's special day today. Regardless of others, as long as we're happy, that's all that matters."

Jin Ge and Xiao Hong, seeing Xia Sang waving at them from the front row, couldn't help but raise their hands and wave back.

"I'm so nervous," Xiao Hong whispered as she waved.

"Have some guttural energy!"

"Jin Ge, stop shaking your legs before you start talking to me!!"

Xia Sang looked at Jin Ge and Xiao Hong from afar, not understanding what they were saying, but still managed a big smile. When he sat down, looking at the blond, blue-eyed foreigners around him, he was still a little nervous, his fingertips icy cold.

Just as he was about to rub his fingers, a pair of large, warm hands grasped his. He turned his head and saw Liang Yiming looking at him gently, lightly stroking his fingers. The warmth gradually soothed his coldness.

It's alright. Three years of filming, numerous reshoots, and re-editing. He did his best.

Even Liang Ye's illness had improved considerably; now he could basically interact normally with others without gloves.

Everything was getting better.

He held Liang Yiming's hand tightly. Neither of them spoke, but everything was understood in their eyes.

Liang Yiming looked up at Xia Sang's image and artwork projected onto the stage, and couldn't help but sigh at how quickly time had passed.

Last year, the Liang Group's board of directors reinstated Liang Yiming as CEO. Ms. Lin flew back abroad to live and work. Before returning, she had a conversation with Liang Yiming; no one knew what they discussed.

Afterward, Ms. Lin didn't interfere in their lives, but seeing Xia Sang's still disdainful expression, Xia Sang could only smile helplessly. Liang Yiming, on the other hand, sternly stopped Ms. Lin.

Yes, everything was fine.

As the list was read out, the lights in the venue dimmed, leaving only a single beam of light shining in the darkness, swirling, searching for tonight's winner.

The two looked up at the beam of light, its dazzling brilliance shining in their eyes, just like their future.
