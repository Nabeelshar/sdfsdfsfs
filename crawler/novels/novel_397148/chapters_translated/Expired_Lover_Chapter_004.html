Chapter 4 04 Dumped (Revised)

Xia Sang stood to the side, feeling incredibly embarrassed for Bai Tinglin. His whole body went numb, and he wondered what was going on.

Xia Sang didn't realize his gaze was fixed on Liang Yiming and the others.

Suddenly, he saw Liang Yiming turn his head, looking in their direction. Their eyes met, startling Xia Sang.

He immediately retreated behind a pillar, anxiously thinking, "Did Master Liang see me? No, right? So far away, with so many people, he might not even be looking at me. Coincidence! It must be a coincidence!"

Xia Sang kept reassuring himself when suddenly a voice came from behind him, "I found you."

This startled Xia Sang so much he jumped back up.

Jin Fulai, who had just finished talking to several of his agent friends, looked at Xia Sang with a puzzled expression. Why was she reacting so strongly?

Jin Fulai followed Xia Sang's gaze and met Liang Yiming's eyes.

Jin Fulai, waddling his fat body, instantly shrank back to the pillar.

Damn! The party's over, and I still run into this big shot! What luck!

Should I go say hello? There are so many people, and Mr. Liang is with his mistress... never mind.

Jin Fulai quickly pulled Xia Sang away through the other side.

At the entrance of the party, Secretary Zhang received a call from the driver and asked Liang Yiming, "Mr. Liang, the car is here."

Secretary Wang had business at his company, and Secretary Zhang was temporarily filling in for him.

After speaking, not hearing a reply from Liang Yiming, he looked up at Mr. Liang, his expression unreadable, staring in a distant direction.

Secretary Zhang followed the direction—a fat man in a suit was pulling a boy along, running into the distance.

He looked closer; the man's build resembled Mr. Xia.

He wondered why they were running in such a hurry.

"Brother, what are you looking at?" Liang Yize, who arrived late, walked up from behind. Reaching Liang Yiming's side, he spoke, "I can't find him. I don't know where he went."

Then he asked Xiao Zhang, "Has the car arrived?"

"Yes, Mr. Liang," Xiao Zhang, the secretary, replied, bowing his head.

"Then let's go," Liang Yize said to Liang Yiming, glancing intentionally or unintentionally at Bai Tinglin standing nearby.

Xiao Zhang, observing his appearance, remembered that this Mr. Bai was the person recommended by Mr. Liang.

He couldn't help but sigh at the complicated relationship.

"Brother, let's go," Liang Yize urged, seeing nothing as he followed Liang Yiming's gaze.

"Let's go," Liang Yiming said, taking a step.

Xia Sang and Jin Fulai fled to the car. Xiao Hong, seeing their panicked state, laughed, "Did you two commit theft? Why are you so flustered?"

"We were like mice caught by a cat," Jin Ge shouted, getting into the passenger seat. "Let's go, let's go!"

"What nonsense," Xiao Hong muttered, but still obediently started the car.

After driving for a while, Jin Ge suddenly spoke, "Xia Sang, tell me honestly, do you... still want to be with Master Liang?"

"Brother Jin, what's wrong?"

Jin Fulai scratched his head, fidgeting, still feeling that Master Liang might want to get Xia Sang back, unsure how to phrase it. He hadn't finished thinking when he heard Xia Sang reply, "If needed, I'll go back."

Jin Fulai was stunned by this answer and couldn't help but turn to look at Xia Sang. Xia Sang was also looking at him, her amber eyes gleaming faintly in the darkness. This reminded Jin Fulai of the day he found him among the pile of extras—sallow-faced, thin, lying among the dead.

If it weren't for his good bone structure and slender figure, he would have been completely unremarkable among the corpses.

But what truly made Jin Fulai want to sign Xia Sang was the moment she opened her eyes.

That day, the gray sky was oppressive and gloomy. As Xia Sang got up and helped the person beside her, her smile blossomed, and the glimmer in her eyes was like the candlelight attracting a moth.

It made him want to get closer and take a closer look.

At that moment, Jin Fulai thought, I want to sign him! "I want to sign him!"

But fate always likes to play tricks. He couldn't help him, and he didn't manage to sign him; the man ended up back in his own life.

Jin Fulai patted his stomach. "Don't worry about tomorrow, just take it one step at a time. Enjoy today."

"Brother Jin, can't you be a little more ambitious?" Xiao Hong complained. "Where do you get all these grand principles from?"

"Then tell me how to work hard?"

"Like, get a promotion, a raise, and reach the pinnacle of life," Xiao Hong joked.

Brother Jin glanced at him. "Don't try to get your own agenda."

"Hahahaha," Xia Sang chimed in. "Brother Jin will definitely lead us to greater success."

Xiao Hong shouted, "Greater success!"

The atmosphere in the car was relaxed and peaceful. Meanwhile, far away at the villa, Bai Tinglin was gritting his teeth as he put on his sexy lingerie.

After finishing, he stood up and went to the next room.

He was filled with trepidation. When he first entered, Secretary Wang had told him not to enter other rooms without Liang Ye's permission.

But remembering Liang Ye's increasingly cold attitude since their last meeting, Bai Tinglin decided to take a gamble.

Continuing like this would only result in him being replaced; now, a desperate attempt might still offer a chance.

He entered the room and could hear the dripping water from the shower. Bai Tinglin's palms were sweaty, his heart pounding. Looking at the large, vaguely visible figure behind the frosted glass, he exclaimed, "Who would believe it? I, Bai Tinglin, have been with Liang Ye, and we've only exchanged a couple of words in bed; nothing has actually happened."

If he hadn't touched the man's enormous member one morning, he would have doubted Liang Ye's ability.

He was good-looking, with a great physique; countless men wanted to sleep with him.

Bai Tinglin quickly hid on the huge bed in the room, pulling the covers over his head. Darkness enveloped him, and the silky smooth touch beneath him made him gasp.

After a while, the sound of water subsided. He heard Liang Yiming open the bathroom door, slowly walk out, step by step, until he stopped beside his bed.

After a while, the covers were finally pulled back.

Before Bai Tinglin stood Liang Yiming, a white bathrobe draped over his body. The lingering warmth of the water enveloped him like a thin veil. His usually sharp, eagle-like brows now showed a hint of fatigue, making him appear much softer, inspiring an irresistible urge to kiss him and comfort him.

Bai Tinglin reached out, trying to climb onto Master Liang's back. His face was flushed; he'd drunk quite a bit at the party to bolster his courage.

"Master Liang~" he called out.

Master Liang, whose expression had been gentle just moments before, now had a dark expression. "Who let you in?"

"Master Liang, let me keep you company tonight."

"Get out."

Liang Yiming shook off Bai Tinglin's hand. Bai Tinglin fell onto the bed, looking utterly pitiful, large expanses of pale skin exposed, bound only by a few ropes.

Seeing Liang Yiming's furrowed brows, the coldness in his eyes like ice cubes hitting him.

He felt a chill creep through him, unsure what to say.

Liang Yiming picked up the call button on the bedside table. "Butler Liu, please come upstairs."

Without even glancing at Bai Tinglin, Liang Yiming went to the wardrobe and took out a silk robe. Bai Tinglin's muddled mind immediately cleared, and he hurriedly apologized, "I'm sorry, Master Liang, I'm sorry."

"Get out." Liang Yiming took off his clothes and changed into the new robe. "Don't make me say it a third time."

"Also, tell Liang Yize not to prepare any more people for me."

Bai Tinglin nodded hastily, immediately stood up, and ran out.

After getting dressed, Liang Yiming whistled softly towards the window. A majestic golden retriever strode in from its doghouse outside, startling Bai Tinglin, who was dressed and about to go downstairs.

Robles, the big dog, never liked him. If no one was around, he would bark at him or try to scare him.

He leaned against the wall, waiting for Robles to run over before leaving.

Robles ran over and pounced on Liang Yiming, cuddling him affectionately for a while before getting down.

After getting down, Robles continued walking into the room, wandering around, but not finding anyone, he went back to Liang Yiming, whimpering.

"He's not here," Liang Yiming said, pulling Robles along. "To the study."

When they reached the door, Butler Liu was already standing there. Liang Yiming instructed, "Change the bed."

"Yes, sir," Butler Liu nodded.

After spending half the day working in his study, Liang Yiming finally brought Robles back to bed. Robles rolled over on the bed, then lay down in the middle.

Liang Yiming lay down, stroking Robles several times until he felt more comfortable, then drifted off to sleep.

In the middle of the night, a gentle breeze blew.

Liang Yiming sat up restlessly, the longing for a hug making him sleepless again.

He stood up and took a cold shower, suppressing his emotions.

After showering, he went up to the gym on the third floor, turned on the treadmill, and began exercising aimlessly, trying to suppress the feelings that were beyond his control.

He had been suffering from insomnia for a long time.

This would affect his performance and cause him to lose his usual accurate judgment at work.

This was something Liang Ye absolutely could not accept.

Looking down from the floor-to-ceiling windows in front of the treadmill, he could see the villa's large garden and Robles' nearly 100-square-meter doghouse villa. He remembered the time Xia Sang caused trouble; after he kicked her out, he sat in the living room drinking hot tea, waiting for his body to calm down. A cup of hot tea calmed him down, but Xia Sang didn't even knock on the door.

Opening the door, he found Xia Sang lying on the floor in Robles' doghouse, asleep.

Sometimes Liang Yiming wondered, what exactly was going on in Xia Sang's head?
