Chapter 8 Villa 08

Unequal status inevitably leads to a lack of empathy.

Upon hearing Master Liang's assessment, Xia Sang forced a smile and replied, "I see."

Soon the car arrived at the villa. Xia Sang opened the door and got out. Robles, who was waiting at the gate with Butler Liu, saw her and wagged his tail, running over and circling around her.

His fluffy tail tickled Xia Sang's calves.

"Radish, it tickles," Xia Sang laughed, taking out a new toy for Robles. "Look at the toy your brother bought you."

Robbles ignored the toy, continuing to pounce on Xia Sang, whimpering softly, as if complaining about her coming home so late.

Xia Sang tenderly ruffled Robles's hair, "My little darling, why do you miss your brother so much?"

When Liang Yiming entered, Xia Sang was already rolling around on the floor with Robles in her arms. Liang Yiming took off his coat and gave it to Butler Liu, indicating that dinner could begin.

"Eat first."

Xia Sang immediately got up and, for the first time in a long time, sat down to eat with Master Liang. Having not visited the villa for several months, Xia Sang felt a little reserved.

The excitement from playing with Robles earlier vanished instantly, but thankfully, Robles was lying at his feet, giving him some sense of security.

He took a bite, marveling at Zhang Ma's cooking, which was as good as ever.

The two ate alone.

Liang Yiming didn't like too many people walking around the house; it was too noisy for him. Generally, maids would return to their rooms to rest after finishing their work, waiting for Butler Liu's instructions and the call bell.

After dinner, while Master Liang was on the phone, Xia Sang went to the living room sofa to eat some fruit.

Robbs followed him, still making a fuss at his feet—trying to snatch the apple from his hand.

He looked at the familiar surroundings, somewhat dazed; he hadn't realized he was actually back here.

Only at this moment did he truly feel it.

Before he knew it, Robles had climbed onto Xia Sang's lap, opened his mouth, and put Xia Sang's hand and the apple in his mouth, getting apple juice and Robles' saliva all over Xia Sang's hand.

“You can only eat a little apple.” Xia Sang handed the apple to Robles, patting its head. “Why are you so domineering, just like your owner?”

And what else could he do but give it to him?

Snatching food from a tiger's mouth? This period of turmoil hadn't been enough. He knew Master Liang had shown leniency, hadn't blacklisted him, hadn't sidelined him, just intercepted a few announcements, given him a verbal warning, and now was even giving him a way out.

Like Xiao Hong always complains, if the higher-ups give you a way out, you have to step down.

What are you doing standing up there, just enjoying the breeze?

We've been lovers for two years already, what's two more years?

Xia Sang got up, washed his hands in the bathroom next to the living room, and rinsed his mouth.

He sat waiting for Grandpa Liang to come over. When Grandpa Liang arrived, he reached out and offered his hand.

As Grandpa Liang shook his hand, he moved closer, embraced him, and buried his face in Grandpa Liang's neck, gently pressing it against his own.

Liang Yiming gently stroked his head twice.

Xia Sang suddenly felt a little ashamed. He didn't understand why he hadn't felt this way before, but now he felt uncomfortable all over.

He kissed Liang Yiming's chin, and Grandpa Liang slowly lowered his head to return the kiss.

Xia Sang glanced out of the corner of his eye at their silhouettes reflected in the French windows, looking just like an intimate couple.

But they might not be.

In an instant, his mouth filled with bitterness, which he could only swallow. He wasn't actually someone who easily felt bitterness.

Abandoned by his parents as a child, he was taken in and raised by his grandmother. He endured scavenging for garbage, being laughed at for not being able to afford school, but he didn't care because his grandmother loved him; those things were others' fault.

But he liked Grandpa Liang, so he cared.

How could he not like or love Grandpa Liang? When he needed help the most, Grandpa Liang helped him.

He wore clothes he never dared to dream of before, lived in a room where the bathroom was bigger than his old bedroom, and Grandpa Liang even tutored him.

He didn't want to lose face in front of Grandpa Liang again, but it seems the more one cares, the more easily one goes to extremes—extreme care, extreme love. But for a country bumpkin like him, the more he tried in front of these high-society figures, the more humiliating he became. After making so many embarrassing mistakes, he realized that all those favors were merely gifts handed to him, things he could never attain.

Liang Yiming, aroused by Xia Sang's kiss, steadily lifted her up like a child. He felt Xia Sang's legs wrapped around his waist, her hands resting on his shoulders.

Their limbs seemed to melt from the heat of their bodies, becoming intertwined.

Their eyes met, and Xia Sang averted his gaze, hiding his face. Suddenly, he felt as if a cold, slippery snake was coiling around his back, starting from his tailbone, tightening the air inside him, slowly suffocating him. Before he knew it, the snake seemed to have burrowed into Liang Yiming's body.

Xia Sang felt a surge of heat, pleasure surpassing reason. He let himself be immersed in this feeling.

A trickle of moisture flowed through his parched body, nourishing the earth. The desire hidden deep within was repeatedly moistened, revived, and burst forth like vines, clinging firmly to another body.

…

“Master Liang, put me down.” Xia Sang felt utterly insecure being held so high up. His legs were weak, and he was terrified that Liang Yiming might throw him off in a fit of anger. Xia Sang gave a pitiful smile. “I’m scared.”

Liang Yiming looked at him strangely. Usually, when they were like this, Xia Sang didn’t tremble so much. But now, lying so softly in his arms, Xia Sang was softer than ever before.

Liang Yiming smiled to himself, unsure whether it was at Xia Sang’s pitiful appearance or at what he had just said. He kissed Xia Sang’s lips again.

...

Xia Sang was carried upstairs in a daze. As he sank into the soft bed, he instinctively wrapped his arms around Liang Yiming's neck.

The flickering light made Xia Sang dizzy, and he eventually fainted.

...
Xia Sang was woken up by Liang Yiming in the middle of the night. He looked at Liang Yiming; his eyes were closed, clearly still asleep.

Xia Sang struggled to open his eyes and glanced down. Liang Yiming's hand was still unconsciously caressing his waist, gently stroking it as if touching a piece of fine silk, soft and pleasant in his sleep.

Xia Sang turned his head and buried his head back into the pillow, falling asleep again.

He was utterly exhausted.

Meanwhile, Liang Yiming, as usual, leaned forward and pulled Xia Sang completely into his arms.

*
The next day, when Xia Sang woke up, no one was beside him. Looking up at the clock, he saw it was already 11 a.m., almost noon.

He reached for his phone on the bedside table, wanting to play for a while, but found it was out of battery. He could only roll around in bed a couple of times, shivering a little, but ended up howling in pain. He hadn't done those things for too long last night, and his muscles were strained.

"Woof woof woof!" Robles, who had been lying quietly by the bed, heard Xia Sang's voice and immediately stood up, leaning over the bed to call his little friend.

Xia Sang turned her head and saw Robles' big head approaching. "Robbery, why did you come in? Did you miss your brother?"

"Woof!"

Robbles jumped up, its tail wagging incessantly, making Xia Sang's heart melt.

Xia Sang moved, stretched out her body, and stroked the golden retriever's head. Robles, receiving a response, became even more affectionate, smearing saliva all over Xia Sang's face, and finally resting its entire head against Xia Sang's neck.

"Oh, my little darling." Xia Sang hugged Robles' head and kissed it. "Give your brother a kiss, and I'll take you for a walk later."

"Woof!"

Xia Sang asked again, "Where's your dad?"

"Woof!!" Robles barked towards the door.

Robles was quite clever. When Master Liang went out, it would bark at the window; when he was home, it would bark towards the house.

"Oh dear, your dad really isn't working hard enough. Does he even care about this business empire?" Xia Sang said, her expression downcast, unable to laugh.

He sat for a while, then patted his face. "Xia Sang, it's time to bring out the acting skills Jin Ge trained you in! Do your job well, play your role well!"

Xia Sang encouraged himself. Robles, thinking he was joking, leaned closer, wanting him to pat his face too.

Xia Sang reached out and rubbed Robles' face, and Robles patiently rubbed it back.

Xia Sang was happily kneading his hands when someone gently knocked on the door. He heard Butler Liu's voice, "Mr. Xia, breakfast is ready. If you're up, you can get up and have some."

"Yes, yes," Xia Sang quickly replied, feeling bad for troubling the elderly Butler Liu.

After quickly washing up, Xia Sang followed Butler Liu and Robles downstairs.

Turning a left turn downstairs, he saw Master Liang sitting at the dining table, eating breakfast and reading the newspaper.

The newspaper obscured Master Liang's face, but from above, he had a long neck, a taut chest, strong arms, and was wearing a black silk bathrobe—quite flamboyant.

Robles beat Xia Sang to the punch, walking up to Liang Yiming. It circled him, its long, golden-brown fur brushing against his calves, making the slit in his bathrobe open even wider, exuding an even more explosive masculinity.

Putting everything else aside, Xia Sang was incredibly envious of Liang Yiming's physique. If he had that body, he'd immediately take on a gym ad!

While Xia Sang was lost in thought, Liang Yiming put down his newspaper and stared directly at her. His dark, sharp eyes shattered the previous romantic atmosphere, like the arrogant and domineering gaze of an eagle soaring high in the sky.

Xia Sang felt as if she'd been doused with a bucket of cold water, instantly sobering up.

"What are you doing there?" Liang Yiming asked, putting away his newspaper.

"Good morning, Grandpa Liang." Xia Sang waved to Liang Yiming, trying to smile like a lucky cat.

"Come here."

"Okay." Xia Sang replied.

Xia Sang approached the dining table and saw his favorite shumai, fried dough sticks, and soy milk; her stomach began to rumble.

Liang Yiming liked Western-style breakfasts, and Zhang Ma at the villa always prepared Western food for him. At this moment, only a steaming cup of dark Americano remained in front of Grandpa Liang, indicating he had just finished breakfast.

"Eat." Xia Sang sat down and began to eat.

"Did you sleep well last night?" Grandpa Liang seemed to be in a good mood, having time to chat.

"Good." Xia Sang answered cautiously, "Very good."

After that, the two fell silent.

“Master Liang, I’d like to take Robles out for a walk later,” Xia Sang asked after they’d almost finished eating.

“Hmm. You can play with him if you have time.”

“Okay.”

Another silence followed.

Liang Yiming finished his coffee and said to Xia Sang, “After you’re done eating, come upstairs and tie my tie.”

Xia Sang nodded and followed Liang Yiming into the walk-in closet on the second floor.

Xia Sang looked at the rows of ties with some difficulty, feeling overwhelmed. He didn’t tie ties for Master Liang often; Master Liang would only call him occasionally when he felt like it.

“You pick a tie,” Master Liang said, taking off his bathrobe and buttoning his shirt button by button in front of the mirror. His muscles pushed up the collar of his shirt, making him look tall and handsome. Xia Sang looked around and finally chose a navy blue tie with white polka dots and dark black stripes.

Liang Yiming looked up at the tie and said, "Your taste really hasn't changed."
