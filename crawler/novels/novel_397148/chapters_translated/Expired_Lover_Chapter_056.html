Chapter 80, Part 55

Xu Juan arrived at work early in the morning and saw Xia Sang already waiting in the office with her camera. "Xia Sang, so early today?" Entering, she didn't see her usual figure. "Mr. Liang isn't here?"

Xia Sang was fiddling with the camera, her expression trying to hide something. Xu Juan found it amusing. "What's wrong? Did you two have a fight?"

"No," Xia Sang murmured softly.

Xu Juan couldn't help but laugh. Xia Sang always seemed a bit childish in her presence.

“I know your relationship with Mr. Liang is special.” There was no one else in the office. Sister Juan walked up to Xia Sang and gently patted his shoulder. “You need to think clearly about what you want.”

Judging from Xia Sang's appearance before, Xu Juan thought he was a minor internet celebrity. She even looked him up online, never expecting him to be a star, and someone who had experienced such a thing. She didn't know how much was true and how much was false; it was all Xia Sang's private matter.

“Sister Juan?” Xia Sang looked up at Sister Juan's gentle eyes. Sister Juan knew his past, but in the year they had known each other, she had never mentioned it.

“That's all in the past.” Xu Juan smiled, and in Xia Sang's eyes, she seemed to overlap with the image of his childhood teacher, Ms. Xu.

“Your own decision is the most important,” Xu Juan told Xia Sang, “but you must move on.” Don't be trapped in the past. Even as a child in the mountains, you must go out.

"Thank you," Xia Sang couldn't help but call out, "Teacher Xu."

He would think it over carefully, he would think about his relationship with Grandpa Liang, and what to do next.

"Alright, get ready, we'll get going up the mountain. Grandma Li will stay with you." Xu Juan distributed the gifts and waited for the others to gather.

"Okay!" Xia Sang smiled.

When everyone had arrived, Xia Sang noticed that Grandpa Liang and Qin Lang had also come over.

"Hi, we came to see you." Qin Lang greeted them first, waving at Xia Sang.

Xia Sang nodded, somewhat silent, but still slowly walked to Liang Yiming and the others.

He was a little flustered at the moment. He had thought he could avoid Grandpa Liang today and calm down, but seeing Liang Yiming only made him more flustered.

“Look, he's even ignoring me,” Qin Lang whispered to Liang Yiming, thinking, “Isn't it really that cigarette that caused this mess?”

Liang Yiming frowned upon hearing Qin Lang's words.

Liang Yiming knew Xia Sang was resisting, but he was also trying to decipher her resistance. Xia Sang's willingness to help him meant she still had feelings for him.

If she did, he would fight for it.

A business deal isn't something that can be closed in one go.

“Where are you going?” Qin Lang asked.

“We're going up the mountain to offer our condolences,” Xia Sang replied.

“I see…” Qin Lang thought for a moment; it wouldn't be convenient for Master Liang to come. Unexpectedly, Liang Yiming spoke up himself, saying, “I'll go with you.”

Xia Sang was somewhat stunned.

"What, you look down on me?" Liang Yiming asked directly when Xia Sang didn't speak immediately. It was true that his physical condition was inconvenient, but he knew Xia Sang would agree.

Sure enough, Xia Sang immediately retorted, "No... Mr. Liang, of course you can go if you want."

Liang Yiming gave a very faint, almost imperceptible smile. He knew Xia Sang would agree. As long as he succeeded, what did it matter if he used his weakness as a weapon?

Qin Lang seized the opportunity and immediately said he had an online psychological consultation, handed Liang Yiming over to Xia Sang, and left quickly.

Xia Sang could only take Liang Yiming with her to Grandma Li's house. The mountain path wasn't easy to walk, but fortunately, Liang Yiming had been practicing with his cane these past few days and was walking much faster than before. With Xia Sang guiding him, they walked steadily.

Xia Sang didn't speak the whole way.

Liang Yiming didn't speak either.

The two arrived at Grandma Li's house in silence.

After hearing Xia Sang greet Grandma Li, Liang Yiming was led to a stool. The stool was small; it was more like a half-squatting position for Liang Yiming than sitting. The house also had a damp, long-standing smell.

Xia Sang turned to look at Grandpa Liang sitting there awkwardly, and found it strangely funny. Such a tall person, shrunk to a tiny size.

Xia Sang gave the gifts to Grandma Li. Grandma Li had a lame son who worked in the village, and she was usually home alone. Xia Sang couldn't help but give her a few more words of advice.

As he spoke, he turned on the TV in Grandma Li's house. It was an old drama he had copied for her; its grayish hues were Grandma Li's favorite color.

It was a very old TV series.

Xia Sang walked over to Liang Yiming and recorded this scene of Grandma Li from a distance. As he filmed, he said, "Grandma Li has watched this TV series twice, and she cried every time."

But she didn't like watching it alone; she liked waiting for him to watch it together.

Xia Sang knew that she wanted him to stay with her longer.

Liang Yiming listened, perhaps at this moment, Xia Sang's mind was preoccupied with other things, as if yesterday's events were already in the past, the awkwardness gone.

He suggested, "Why don't you act out a scene for Grandma Li? Maybe she'll be happy."

"..." Grandpa Liang was trying to kill him, Xia Sang gritted her teeth, "Grandpa Liang, sometimes you should just shut your mouth."

Liang Yiming chuckled.

He heard Xia Sang pacing back and forth again, "What are you doing?"

"I'm filming footage."

"Filming footage?"

"Yes, I want to make a documentary about the village. I told Sister Juan and the others before, and they said it was okay." Xia Sang was focused on finding the right angle.

"You can even make films?" Liang Yiming was surprised; he had never heard of it before.

Xia Sang smiled. Perhaps Grandpa Liang didn't remember, but among the many classes Grandpa Liang had enrolled him in was a photography course, perhaps to help him find subjects more easily. However, during the course, he discovered that Xia Sang seemed to prefer being behind the camera rather than appearing in it.

"I like it."

Liang Yiming suddenly fell silent. He and Xia Sang had been together for over two years, and he felt he truly didn't understand her.

Xia Sang and Liang Yiming spent the afternoon with Grandma Li. When they left, Grandma Li reluctantly told Xia Sang to come again and gave her a bag of peanuts.

On the way back, Xia Sang told Grandpa Liang, "Let's go to another place." Liang Yiming followed. When they arrived, they realized it was Grandma Xia's grave.

Xia Sang cleaned Grandma Xia's grave. It wasn't far from Grandma Li's house; he would come to visit after each visit to Grandma Li.

Liang Yiming bowed three times to Grandma Xia. "Hello, Grandma Xia, nice to meet you. I'm Liang Yiming," he introduced himself somewhat formally.

"I'm sorry I couldn't help you back then."

Xia Sang shook her head and said, "It's alright."

Liang Yiming felt a pang of regret. "It's a pity Grandma didn't know me."

Xia Sang hesitated for a moment, then slowly said, "Grandma actually knew you."

Liang Yiming was surprised.

When he met Xia Sang, Grandma Xia had already fallen ill, and after that, she was in a vegetative state. How could she know him?

“Grandma knew I was gay,” Xia Sang said. “She was shocked and thought there was something wrong with me. She took me to see a doctor, who said it was normal.”

“She found it hard to accept, but Grandma chose to listen to the doctor’s answer.”

“Even when she was busy, she started noticing people walking together with two boys.”

After a while, Grandma couldn’t help but ask Xia Sang, “Why didn’t I notice you were gay?”

This made Xia Sang laugh and cry at the same time.

Later, Xia Sang explained to her grandmother, who became sad again. "This path is too difficult. What will you do after I'm gone?" Grandma Xia held Xia Sang's hand. "It's so much more stable with girls. Can't you like girls? Can you change?"

In Grandma Xia's eyes, Xia Sang was her beloved grandson. She didn't want him to suffer. Even now, she still didn't understand that it wasn't an illness, nor was it a choice that could be changed, but she was learning to accept it.

“Alright,” Grandma Xia said, “then where can I watch gay movies? I’ll go pick one out for you.”

Xia Sang laughed heartily as she recounted the past, her laughter like the wind brushing against her face. Liang Yiming listened to the rustling of the wind, his vision blurry. The black, hazy mist seemed to be swept away by the green shadows of the trees, leaving scattered gaps. The next moment, it disappeared again, returning to darkness.

Liang Yiming clenched his fists, remaining silent.

His heart pounded.

Xia Sang and Liang Yiming descended the mountain. Before they even reached the gate, they heard a dog barking. Opening the door, they saw Assistant Manager Wang standing in the garden with a golden retriever.

Xia Sang ran over excitedly. That cute yet fierce little dog—who else could it be but Radish! "Mr. Xia, hello," Assistant Wang greeted. "Robles is all better now, I brought him over to keep Master Liang company."

Robles barked excitedly, "Woof!"

"You still remember your brother, you missed your brother, didn't you!"

"Woof!"

"My goodness, Radish is still as handsome as ever!"

"Woof!"

Robles turned and saw Liang Yiming, becoming even more excited. Wagging his tail, he rushed over and lay down on Liang Yiming's lap for a hug.

Liang Yiming couldn't see Robles, so he could only rely on the feel of his leg to locate Robles' face.

Xia Sang smiled happily at this scene. Just then, a familiar voice came from the courtyard, "Brother Xia, we're here too."

It was Brother Jin and Xiao Hong who came out!

"Brother Xia, I'm done with my work. Yuan Ziyi went to acting training, and Brother Jin had some free time, so we came to visit you together!"

"We came with Secretary Wang, aren't you happy? Hahahaha!"

Xiao Hong started talking non-stop.

Suddenly, the scene became lively.
