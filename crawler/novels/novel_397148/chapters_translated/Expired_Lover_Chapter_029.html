Chapter 49 29 Press Conference (Supplement)

The next day, Xia Sang lay on her bed in her apartment, watching the live stream of the press conference on her phone. Mr. Liang was still wearing his usual black suit, the impeccable color concealing his fingers, gloved in black leather, pointing firmly and decisively at the display screen behind him.

This was a clarification of the previously circulated information about the new drug.

The incident of a mother and daughter dying simultaneously due to the new drug from the Liang Group was caused by improper medication administration by the patient's family.

During the normal treatment process, the patient's family privately administered self-purchased tonics to the patient. The tonics produced a drug reaction that interacted with the new drug.

Fortunately, the interaction between the previous medication and the tonics was not as strong, so it wasn't discovered in time.

After switching to a new medication, significant drug interactions led to an excessive burden on the body, which the already weakened patient could not withstand, indirectly causing death.

"These are the relevant medical test results, and we are deeply saddened by these findings," Liang Yiming explained simply, then listed the test reports. The flashing lights illuminated Liang Yiming's face, his deep features and resolute gaze making him even more charismatic.

The flashes continued, and Liang Yiming controlled the pace of the entire press conference.

"At the same time, we are also verifying and initiating investigations with relevant departments. Those who spread rumors about our company using unverified information will be prosecuted according to law for the social impact and reputational damage caused!" Liang Yiming's voice grew increasingly firm and powerful. “This new drug is designed to make treatment costs and effectiveness more affordable for patients. We hope everyone can learn more about the new treatment jointly developed by Liang's and Ye's Pharmaceuticals. Thank you!” After saying this, Liang Yiming stood up and bowed in thanks.

The spotlight shone on him, making him radiant.

The press conference lasted about one to two hours. Xia Sang, staring at his phone for so long, felt his eyes ache and become dry. He covered his phone with his hand, looked at the ceiling, and comforted himself, “I'm just sad for a little while; I'll be fine soon.”

After this press conference, netizens' opinions and sentiments immediately changed.

Under the official Weibo accounts of Liang's and Ye's Pharmaceuticals, which released corresponding documents and lawyer's letters, many netizens left comments:

1st Floor: The new drug is half the price of the imported drug, so who's in a hurry? It's obvious... Some people are just stirring up trouble.

2nd Floor: Convicting someone based on just a video? Severely punish those who spread rumors!

3rd Floor: The drug is fine, but that doesn't mean the person is fine /doge

4th Floor: What are you talking about upstairs?!

...
Although most of the comments were positive, the Xiao Lin incident kept being brought up again, and Xia Sang's name also appeared sporadically in the comments.

1st Floor: That Xia Sang too, what dog owner, isn't she...

2nd Floor: What about the Xiao Lin incident?

3rd Floor: Xiao Lin, the core of the Liang Group isn't his adoptive father or agent.

4th Floor: Speechless… I won't mention the Liang Group, but Liang Yize has no way to clear his name, right?

5th Floor: Didn't I say it didn't go beyond the scope of work? Love affairs are a matter of mutual consent.

In the car, Secretary Wang showed the information online to Mr. Liang. Mr. Liang glanced at it briefly, “If the public opinion is improving, that's fine. Have the PR team keep a close eye on it.” He paused for a few seconds before continuing, “Someone also mentioned Xia Sang; suppress that too.”

“Okay.” Secretary Wang, sensing Mr. Liang's thoughts, said softly, “Mr. Xia seems very sad.”

“Mm,” Liang Yiming replied. “Master Liang, I think we should reconsider retaining Mr. Xia’s agreement.”

Liang Yiming noticed that some comments mentioned Xiao Lin, and even included photos of Xiao Lin from his lifetime. The photos showed Xiao Lin in his first year at Morning Star Prison, right after sending his adoptive father and the others there.

His handsome face and gentle smile were striking.

A stark contrast to the photos of him at the time of his death—thin, ashen-faced, and颓废 (颓废 is a difficult word to translate directly, but it implies a state of being listless, dispirited, and exhausted).

After Xiao Lin’s death, Liang Yiming had someone send him all the information Xiao Lin possessed.

When he first looked through Xiao Lin's information, whether it was because he was out of it late at night or because the two people had too many similarities, as he flipped through Xiao Lin's face—a face completely different from Xia Sang's—he found himself strangely and slowly seeing it overlap with Xia Sang's.

Both orphans, both adopted, both kept women.

As Liang Yiming closed his eyes in frustration, trying to clear his head, he suddenly realized that their faces had overlapped with the woman's face from ten years ago.

He threw down the tablet, his limbs itching and aching, feeling nauseous.

The itching from that day lingered, and he hadn't been able to resist embracing Xia Sang again yesterday, but that wasn't a reason for changing his mind.

Liang Yiming placed the tablet on the seat and said coldly, "No need. It's unnecessary."
