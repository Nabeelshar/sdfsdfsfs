Chapter 1 01 Reunion with an Old Flame

Xia Sang followed behind her manager, Brother Jin, secretly rubbing her stomach. She was too full from the meal she'd just eaten.

"What's wrong? Why are you walking so slowly today?" Jin Fulai turned around, looking at his artist with disdain.

"I'm too full." Xia Sang glanced at the hotel entrance, moved closer, and whispered.

Jin Fulai looked helpless. "I'm telling you, when you were with Master Liang, what kind of delicious food didn't you eat? What kind of delicacies didn't you order? Be more mature!"

"But I've terminated my contract with Master Liang now."

Xia Sang's mouth watered at the thought of all the delicious meals she'd had before. "Now, one meal might mean one less." This was the most luxurious hotel in B City, where land is incredibly expensive! "He'll never have a chance to come again."

"Pah, pah, pah! Say something auspicious! Can't we be a little more successful?!" Jin Fulai was also extremely worried. He recalled signing Xia Sang back then because of Xia Sang's handsome face and seemingly clever nature. He thought Xia Sang might be a promising talent, someone he could take care of in the future. He never expected that this guy was just a pretty face.

But then Jin Fulai thought about it again. He himself had only been doing well these past two years thanks to Xia Sang.

"When we become famous, we'll have plenty of opportunities to eat."

"Then I'd better try to eat as much as possible now." Xia Sang was very self-aware.

"...Don't you believe you'll become famous?"

"Do you believe it?" Xia Sang retorted to Brother Jin.

“I used to believe, but now I only have a little,” Jin Fulai sighed. “Why can’t you ever get ahead?”

“Don’t people like me?”

“Everyone says it’s a looks-obsessed world now. Looking like you, how come you’re doing so poorly?”

“Maybe it’s because you’re uneducated?”

“You’ve been with Master Liang for two years, and you’re still a nobody.”

“Maybe it’s because you’re unskilled?”

“Go away, go away, that’s like stabbing someone in the heart.”

Xia Sang smiled, this time saying nothing.

“Alright, alright, you’re only 21, with a bright future ahead of you. Let’s go home.” Jin Fulai waved his hand, gesturing for Xia Sang to follow him.

But before they’d taken a few steps, Xia Sang suddenly pulled Jin Fulai away.

He turned around, about to ask what was wrong, when he heard Xia Sang speak.

"Hey! Hey! Brother Jin, Father Liang's here!" Xia Sang exclaimed excitedly.

Several people entered the hotel. The man at the head of the group was over 1.9 meters tall, dressed in a black suit. He was tall and straight, with sharp eyebrows, slightly dark skin, and chiseled features. He was a man of few words and reserved demeanor, making it somewhat difficult to look directly at him.

Beside him was a handsome young man, following closely behind. Three other men in suits lagged slightly behind, presumably assistants or bodyguards.

Upon seeing the other person, Jin Fulai immediately pulled Xia Sang behind a pillar, shouting at the top of his lungs, "Shut up! Shut up!"

Jin Fulai wiped away a cold sweat. He didn't know why Master Liang was here today. Although Master Liang was their big boss, he wouldn't dare rush up to greet him even if he had ten lives.

After all, two months ago, Master Liang had ended Xia Sang's sugar daddy relationship and signed a new contract. Now that the new girl was smiling, rushing up now would be like picking up manure in a lantern—asking for trouble.

After hiding with lingering fear, Jin Fulai turned around and saw Xia Sang peeking out to watch the commotion. His blood pressure was about to rise. This wretched thing!

Xia Sang was the first artist he mentored during his mid-career transition, but unfortunately, he remained relatively unknown for two years, constantly languishing on the sidelines.

Back then, he had spotted Xia Sang among the many extras in Hengdian World Studios. He had initially intended to sign him, but before the company could approve, Xia Sang found a major investor and ended up working for him.

This shocked Jin Fulai. Upon learning the situation, he felt powerless and angry, wanting to put Xia Sang back in his mother's womb.

But the contract was already signed. Jin Fulai lacked the ability and courage to tear it up with his bare hands at Liang Ye's place. He could only keep a close eye on Xia Sang's movements during this time, preventing him from doing anything foolish.

When the contract expired, Liang Ye didn't renew it. Jin Fulai immediately brainwashed Xia Sang, insisting that the contract shouldn't be renewed.

Even with countless suitors in the entertainment industry, being lovers isn't something to be proud of.

After Liang Yiming and his group went inside, Jin Fulai and Xia Sang emerged from behind a pillar, quickly got into their car, and drove away.

After driving about a mile, Jin Ge suddenly realized something. "Hey? Why did you call Grandpa Liang 'Dad' just now?" Jin Ge's heart skipped a beat. "Does Grandpa Liang have a habit of being called 'Dad'?"

"No, Grandpa Liang likes seeing people begging and pleading." Xia Sang took a jar of candy from the back seat. He was naturally thin, so Jin Fulai didn't restrict his food intake much, but he was worried about his teeth getting cavities. "Every time I call him 'Dad' in bed, he finishes quickly, otherwise he'd keep me up all night. Why doesn't he let me call him 'Grandpa'?"

"You've called Grandpa Liang 'Grandpa' before?" Jin Fulai asked curiously.

"Yes, I have."

"What was Grandpa Liang's reaction?"

"He went limp, and even beat me up."

"Haha..." Xia Sang, you idiot.

Xia Sang didn't tell Jin Fulai what happened next.

After he shouted, before Liang Ye even lost his temper, he couldn't help but burst out laughing.

Finally, Liang Yiming coldly tossed Xia Sang out. He had originally planned to find the nearest hotel to sleep the night, but he forgot that they had gone to a villa halfway up the mountain.

Xia Sang stared blankly at the endless mountain road and the dark mountain scenery in the distance. Would the taxi driver ever make it up?

The cold wind halfway up the mountain almost made Xia Sang lose his mind.

Finally, he saw a miniature version of Radish's dog villa, and shamelessly went to rub against Radish's large doghouse.

That night, he found Radish's doghouse quite warm and comfortable, though it was a bit cramped between them.

Thinking of this, Xia Sang realized he missed Radish a little.

In the hotel conference room, Mr. Ye of Ye's Pharmaceuticals patted his female companion beside him, "When President Liang arrives later, don't stand so close."

"What's wrong?" His companion's red fingertips lightly poked her chest, near her rice bowl.

“That guy isn’t as easy to approach as I am. He hates people who get close without warning. Today’s business is important, don’t cause me any trouble.”

“Understood.” Just then, the door opened, and a tall, handsome man entered with several assistants, looking like characters from a TV drama.

President Ye quickly stepped forward, glanced at him, and raised an eyebrow, teasingly asking, “President Liang, is this a new one?”

“Yes.”

“Didn’t you like the last one?”

“She was alright.”

“Really?” President Ye smiled, hugging his female companion, “I also quite liked that kid; he was very well-behaved.”

Liang Yiming gave him a cold look, and Ye Bin immediately felt a chill run down his spine. “Just kidding, just kidding. I like S-shaped beauties with a great figure.” "

Liang Yiming continued to look at him coldly, "I don't like your jokes. How's the new drug?"

Ye Bin immediately sat up straight, his entire demeanor changing, and earnestly went over every detail of the work with Liang Yiming.

After they finished, the two chatted for a while, and Ye Bin asked, "Mr. Liang, my little darling is also thinking about entering the entertainment industry. I wonder if there are any suitable production crews?"

He turned to his female companion, "Which production crew did you just mention?"

"The new film by Director Li of Morning Star, a company under Liang's umbrella."

The previously quiet boy next to Liang Yiming suddenly leaned closer and said, "Mr. Liang, I also want to act in Director Li's new film." "

Looking at the boy's envious gaze, Liang Yiming recalled Xia Sang. Director Li had also arranged a role for him in his film years ago.

He vaguely remembered something; Director Li had called him directly, going over his family connections in detail, crying and begging him to throw Xia Sang out.

At that time, he returned to the villa, and Xia Sang was taking a shower.

He had just sat down on the sofa in the bedroom when the phone rang. Director Li, Li Guangming, was also an uncle from a wealthy family, passionate about filmmaking. His family had money to produce many high-quality films, but the business didn't go well, so they were affiliated with Liang's company for support.

He answered the phone and heard: "Nephew, why don't you send that kid to someone else to teach? I can't teach a piece of wood. Or perhaps you could give him a less important role?" "You know, he's so tall, he could hold up the sky, he's a pillar..."

Liang Yiming patiently listened to her incessant ranting, finally replying, "Let me see."

So when Xia Sang came out of the shower, she saw Grandpa Liang on the sofa looking at her strangely.

Xia Sang looked at Grandpa Liang curiously. He was wearing a bathrobe, drying his hair, and walked to the sofa, his eyes wide open as he looked at Liang Yiming. "Grandpa Liang, what's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?"

Liang Yiming pinched Xia Sang's cheeks with his thumb and forefinger. His hands were large, completely enveloping half of Xia Sang's face in his palms.

Xia Sang kissed Liang Yiming's palm, then laughed and pulled away. "What's wrong?" "

Xia Sang sat on the sofa, a large towel covering her head, vigorously shaking her hair. Liang Yiming sat on the sofa opposite her, his beautiful almond-shaped eyes slightly lifted, wondering if this person wasn't in pain.

"Director Li called me and told you to leave the crew," Liang Yiming said slowly.

"Huh?" Xia Sang's head popped out from under the towel.

"Director Wang also called me before, telling me not to mess with him anymore." Liang Yiming listed Xia Sang's achievements, especially Director Wang, a notorious commercial director known for making films for money with no bottom line. How bad must Xia Sang's acting be to have driven him to this point?

"You're good-looking, but your acting is so bad?" Liang Yiming raised his chin and pointed at Xia Sang. "What dramas have you acted in? Let me see."

"Huh?" Xia Sang glanced guiltily to the side. "I already said I'd be content with playing minor roles in small productions; I can't handle the good supporting roles."

Xia Sang looked at Liang Yiming with ingratiating eyes. "Change productions? I'm not picky. As long as Grandma can see what I'm in, that's fine."

Liang Yiming asked curiously, "Is your acting really that bad? Let me see."

"No need." "

Uncle Liang insisted, and Xia Sang, feeling guilty, could only reach for her tablet and open the web series he voiced that had the highest rating.

Liang Yiming took it; the screen displayed a gaudy cover with a 3.8 rating.

He raised an eyebrow and started watching the first episode. After a while, Liang Yiming pinched his brow, his mind more muddled than after a day of reading official documents.

Finally, "Xia Sang, change careers."

"This isn't just bad; it's ugly to look at." "Xia Sang's acting has affected his appearance in the play to the point that he looks ugly.

In my memory, Xia Sang was sadly whimpering beside me.
