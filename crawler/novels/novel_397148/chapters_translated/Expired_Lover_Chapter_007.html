Chapter 7 07 Good Girl

"Xia Sang, it seems we were on the wrong track before!" Jin Fulai excitedly scrolled through the comments, unable to believe that his second cross-dressing video would see its Douyin likes skyrocket by 1 million overnight, with more online comments than Xia Sang's entire active fanbase.

Jin Fulai picked up his phone and put it down again, picked it up and put it down again. His short video account was already receiving private messages from small brands offering to sell their products and shoot advertisements.

"We won't add these small brands, but this is a good start!" Jin Fulai was full of enthusiasm, rolling up his sleeves, ready to get to work. "I'll ask the others for advice on how to proceed."

Xia Sang and Xiao Hong cheered from the sidelines, "Brother Jin, that's awesome!" "Brother Jin, you're the best!"

"Keep it low, keep it low," Jin Fulai said, a barely suppressed smile on his face. Summer sunlight streamed in through the window, warm and inviting. In the small office, the three of them felt as if they were melting with joy.

But their happiness was short-lived. There was a knock on the office door, and in entered was General Secretary Wang.

He smiled and said, "Long time no see, Mr. Xia. Could you and Manager Jin please come up to the top-floor office?"

The cramped space in the elevator could barely contain the pounding hearts of Xia Sang and Jin Fulai.

"General Secretary Wang, what brings you all the way from the group?" Jin Fulai asked, stepping forward.

General Secretary Wang glanced at them and said with a smile, "Master Liang is here, so I came over."

"Shall we go upstairs?"

"Just to talk about what we discussed last time."

Jin Fulai thought of the new contract in his office drawer. General Secretary Wang had contacted him before and shown him the new terms, which were even better than before, but Xia Sang said she had no interest, so he declined as well.

"Wasn't this agreed upon last time?" Jin Fulai said softly.

"That depends on Master Liang's arrangements."

Old fox. Jin Fulai cursed inwardly.

The elevator was ready. Secretary Wang gently suggested, "I understand your thinking, but sometimes going with the flow might be better. A head-on confrontation is generally not the best choice."

"Life doesn't only have one path," Jin Fulai chuckled. "We don't have that much ambition; we can't possibly handle that much."

Secretary Wang blocked the opening elevator doors, gesturing for them to exit first. "There's no need to make things so tense, Mr. Xia."

Xia Sang turned to look at Secretary Wang's face and nodded.

"Don't listen to his nonsense. It's not our fault," Jin Fulai whispered in Xia Sang's ear, in a voice only the two of them could hear. "Just listen to me."

Xia Sang smiled at Jin, without responding.

Over the years, he had had more contact with Secretary Wang than Jin Fulai.

Jin Ge was unaware that Secretary Wang's reminder was well-intentioned. The previous warnings were mild and ineffective, but this was the third time Master Liang had spoken to them. Master Liang had made his stance clear, and further harsh words would only make things worse for everyone…

As they spoke, they arrived at the rooftop office. Pushing open the door, they saw Liang Yiming sitting at his desk, seemingly reviewing something.

Secretary Wang stepped forward and stood to Master Liang's left, with Liang Yize standing to his right.

Liang Yiming, seated in the large executive chair in the middle, looked up at him and said, "Have you seen the new contract Secretary Wang showed you? What's wrong with it?"

"No, Master Liang, we have no complaints," Jin Ge replied, rubbing his hands together.

“No, why didn’t you sign?”

“Master Liang, this Xia Sang… we’ve been promoting her for years without her becoming famous, and she doesn’t seem to have much ambition.”

Liang Yiming remained silent.

Jin Fulai had no choice but to continue, “Then it’s to avoid wasting company resources.”

Master Liang still didn’t reply. Xia Sang looked up at the people opposite her; the table seemed to separate them like the Chu River and Han River on a chessboard.

Master Liang’s complexion wasn’t good, and he looked somewhat tired, which made him seem even more formidable. His robust frame sitting in front of them was like a towering mountain, making everyone feel a little breathless.

"Hmph." Liang Yize spoke up from the side, answering Jin Fulai's question, but his eyes were fixed on Xia Sang. "You're ungrateful, putting on airs."

"Didn't you ask my brother to support you before? We begged you!"

"My brother has given you everything he owes you. Your grandmother is still in the hospital, and he's paying for it."

Jin Fulai's head buzzed upon hearing this. He rushed forward to block Xia Sang, "What do you mean, 'you're being ungrateful'? How dare you speak like that?"

"Wasn't it consensual between them? It takes two to tango, haven't you heard? Don't pick on one person."

"Fine, then get out of here if you're so capable. And if you're so capable, then don't use my brother's money. Let's see if you can stay in this circle." Liang Yize's face darkened, his eyes sweeping over Jin Fulai, his words dripping with threat.

"Who's afraid of you!"

Manager Wang inwardly exclaimed "Wow!", marveling at how fierce Xia Sang's agent was.

Jin Fulai wanted to say something more, but Xia Sang stopped him.

Liang Yize was also interrupted by Liang Yiming, "Don't say anything."

Xia Sang knew how petty Liang Yize was; he didn't want Jin to confront him. Perhaps he had been cowardly for a moment, but seeing Jin's back as he stood before him, he felt it didn't matter anymore.

It wasn't like it was his first time being a mistress; it wasn't actually that hard to accept.

Xia Sang picked up the contract on the table, glanced at it, and saw that the terms were better than before. At least Mr. Liang was a good boss.

"Young Mr. Liang, we didn't say we wouldn't sign, no need to be so agitated," Xia Sang said.

Jin Ge wanted to advise Xia Sang, but she shook her head. "It's not like it's the first time. Mr. Liang is just not used to it yet."

Liang Yiming frowned upon hearing this, but Secretary Wang reminded him, "Mr. Liang, your scheduled time is up. The group has a meeting, so you need to leave now."

"Okay." Liang Yiming stood up. "That's all for today. Secretary Wang will make arrangements for you."

Liang Yize walked at the back and glared at them.

Downstairs at the company, General Secretary Wang opened the car door for Mr. Liang, reporting on the schedule. After they finished, Liang Yiming handed the documents in his hand to General Secretary Wang, saying, "Have someone arrange for him to appear on this variety show."

"Okay, Mr. Liang."

"Brother, why are you so nice to Xia Sang?" Liang Yize asked casually.

"Don't always speak so bluntly. You're all grown up now."

"You're just biased towards him!" Liang Yize moved closer to Liang Yiming, but knowing Liang Yiming didn't like others getting close, he could only hold back.

"Don't always say things like that." After saying that, Liang Yiming closed his eyes to rest.

Seeing this, Liang Yize had no choice but to fall silent.

“Damn it, we weren’t the ones who said we were breaking up! Can’t we even have a choice about getting back together? You’re crazy!” Jin Fulai kicked the table, then doubled over in pain, clutching his leg.

“Brother Jin, let’s not pretend to be cool.” Xiao Hong helped Jin Fulai to the sofa, speechless.

“Brother Jin, be careful.” Xia Sang poured Jin Fulai a glass of water. “Don’t be so angry. At least we don’t have to worry about the resources anymore.”

“Master Liang might get tired of it soon. Let’s just focus on making money.” Xia Sang comforted Jin Fulai.

Jin Fulai replied helplessly, then asked another question, “Are you going back to the apartment tonight?”

“No, Secretary Wang said he’ll pick me up from the company tonight.”

The group suddenly fell silent.

"Xiaxia, you need to take it easy."

"Of course, Brother Jin," Xia Sang smiled, "From now on, it'll be great days of making money!"

Jin Fulai looked grave. Seeing this, Xiao Hong quickly cheered them on, trying to liven things up. Looking at Xia Sang's smile, he felt a pang of sadness. Did she really not care?

He wanted to ask, but he didn't dare.

That night, Xia Sang arrived at the parking lot. A familiar luxury car was parked there. He opened the door and saw Liang Yiming sitting inside. He slowly got in.

Liang Yiming didn't speak, looking exhausted. His glasses couldn't hide the dark circles under his eyes, and his head throbbed. He watched Xia Sang slowly inching in like a snail and laughed in exasperation. This guy, where did he get all this drama from?

He said to Xia Sang, "Come here."

Xia Sang hesitated for a moment, but obediently went over.

Liang Yiming pulled Xia Sang into his arms. Xia Sang quickly steadied herself, afraid of crushing him.

Liang Yiming ruffled Xia Sang's hair, his eyes fixed on her. His other hand traced a path from her hair down her cheek, finally slipping inside her clothes to her familiar back, gently stroking it. He buried his face in the crook of her neck, breathing heavily.

Xia Sang dared not move, swallowing hard, feeling her fingers and body growing warm.

Wouldn't Master Liang want something to happen here?

"Master Liang," Xia Sang whispered.

No one answered.

“Grandpa Liang.”

Still no response.

Xia Sang looked down and found that Grandpa Liang seemed to be asleep, his high nose affectionately nuzzling against her neck, his warm breath exuding a sense of peace.

Xia Sang didn't know if Grandpa Liang was really asleep or not, but he didn't dare move. He quietly watched Liang Yiming.

The car drove smoothly on the road. Soon, Grandpa Liang woke up again, as if he hadn't slept at all.

“How long did I sleep?”

“Maybe 20 minutes?”

Liang Yiming sat up and pinched his nose.

The two sat quietly for a while before Liang Yiming spoke, "After you left, Robles hasn't been doing well. I was away on a business trip these past few days, and the vet said it might be separation anxiety. Go back and see it; it will be happy."

Hearing about Robles' condition, Xia Sang asked anxiously, "How could this happen?"

Robes was a very lively and adorable little dog.

"You spoil him too much."

"...No, really?" Xia Sang quickly replied, "Let's stop at the pet store up ahead. I'll buy him a toy later. Do you still have the chew toy I bought last time?"

"It's all chewed up."

"What about the treats?"

"None."

...
"No wonder, you never buy Radish any. He really likes it." Xia Sang looked at Liang Yiming with an irresponsible father's expression.

Liang Yiming listened to Xia Sang's accusation, "He never used to have these habits."

Xia Sang said guiltily, recalling that he usually just gave him a few more treats, gave him more kisses than his owner, and liked to use his vocal cords to coax him, pretending to be a dog to play with him.

Comparing Robles' shrewd demeanor when they first arrived at Master Liang's villa to his later playful antics in the mud, well, it seems, perhaps, it might actually be true.

After buying the toys, Xia Sang remembered something else: the boy he'd seen at the hotel and the party that day. Two tigers cannot share one mountain, and even the tea-serving eunuch couldn't fight with the young lady. He cautiously inquired, "Is that boy at the villa?"

If he is, he won't go today. Xia Sang silently added in his mind.

"That boy..." Liang Yiming slightly turned his head to look at him, "...has already left."

Xia Sang had only been worried about awkwardness and misunderstandings, but he hadn't expected to receive this news—there hadn't been any rumors about it at the company.

Completely puzzled, he asked, "Why?"

"Robes doesn't like him."

Unable to refute.

"So, did Grandpa Liang ask me to come back because Robles likes me?" Xia Sang asked.

Liang Yiming looked at Xia Sang, "I like you too."

Xia Sang was stunned.

Liang Yiming added without hesitation,

"You're the best."
