Chapter 81, Page 56

Xia Sang led everyone inside, and they enjoyed a lively meal that evening.

After dinner, General Secretary Wang called Liang Yiming outside. The moonlight lazily streamed down, casting their silhouettes in the courtyard.

“Mr. Liang, the project in the west of the city lost the bid.” General Secretary Wang stood beside Liang Yiming, gazing at the scattered lights of the village, somewhat dazed. It was so quiet here.

Completely different from the mess in City B. Before leaving, Mr. Liang had left him in the group as an informant, and quite a few things had happened in the past few months.

The timing of Grandpa Liang's departure was quite coincidental. Several projects were being handed over and tendered, and Grandpa Liang had already made arrangements in advance. But Liang Jinfeng arrived, eager to show off in front of Grandpa Liang; he would definitely try to snatch them away.

He would try to snatch them, and given Liang Jinfeng's personality, something bad was bound to happen.

Liang Yiming rubbed his fingers; the friction between his gloves felt like scratching an itch through a boot—itchy, but unable to reach the itch, very unbearable.

Liang Jinfeng had been suppressed for so many years; how hard would he try to scratch that itch? He had foreseen this moment when Liang Yiming was about to leave, using a strategic retreat.

The general secretary, Wang, continued, "The old man couldn't get through to you on the phone, so he called me and told me to make sure you come back."

Did his grandfather really think that Liang Jinfeng's departure was solely his doing?

A person who is ambitious but shallow, yet eager to show off, is bound to ruin themselves.

Liang Yiming felt a slight itch in his throat and wanted a cigarette, but he raised his hand, then lowered it again, exhaling.

"Grandpa Liang, according to the plan, you have to go back," the general secretary reminded him. They wanted to embarrass Liang Jinfeng, but they also had to control the group's losses.

Liang Yiming didn't respond.

He listened to Xia Sang and Jin Fulai laughing and talking behind him, while Robles barked and yelped inside, being teased by Xiao Hong. A pang of reluctance stirred in his heart.

Just like that, he left?

Inside the house.

“Brother Xia, how are things going with you and Grandpa Liang?” Xiao Hong cradled Robles’ head, leaning close to Xia Sang, her eyes sparkling with gossip. “Any sparks flying? Like rain after a long drought?”

Jin Fulai slapped Xiao Hong on the head. “What nonsense are you talking about?”

Startled, Xiao Hong grabbed Robles’ fur. Robles yelped in pain and hopped away to the side.

“What?! Brother Jin, don’t ask again! Humph!” Then, Xiao Hong asked another question, “Brother Xia, where are we staying tonight?”

Before, he and Brother Xia each had their own room, but now that Master Liang is staying here, where will they stay?

“…” Xia Sang hesitated for a moment, “Master Liang and I will share a room, you and Brother Jin will share a room, and Secretary Wang can share with Doctor Qin.”

“What?” Xiao Hong tugged at Xia Sang’s clothes, “Didn’t you just say you weren’t together? How come you’re staying together!” Even Jin Fulai’s eyes widened, looking like he was about to burst, gritting his teeth, “Xia Sang, you better explain this to me!”

…
After Xia Sang finished speaking, Master Liang wanted him to come back.

Xiao Hong and Jin Fulai slammed their fists on the table, “He’s giving us face! I’m telling you, Xia Sang, we don’t agree.”

“Shameless!” Jin Fulai exclaimed. “Yes, at least a million or two, no, not enough, a million or eighty million.” Xiao Hong said.

“No, it’s not about the money!” Jin Fulai slapped Xiao Hong again. What was this girl thinking all day? “It’s this person who’s no good!”

“What person is no good?”

“It’s Master Liang…” Jin Fulai started to say, then immediately realized that it wasn’t Xia Sang or Xiao Hong’s voice.

“Secretary Wang.” Jin Fulai forced a smile on his fat face, turned around and saw Secretary Wang behind him, while Master Liang stood behind Secretary Wang, having overheard everything.

“I’m talking about a friend, a friend.”

“Tch.” Liang Yiming scoffed.

Jin Fulai and Xiao Hong grabbed the pots and pans from the table and rushed into the kitchen, then dispersed.

The general secretary, Wang, was amused by their antics. "Master Liang, it's alright, I'll go back to Mr. Qin's place then."

"Okay."

After the general secretary left, only Xia Sang, Liang Yiming, and Robles remained.

Roboles played with the insects for a while, then, seeing Xiao Hong leave, nestled between the two, wagging its tail.

Liang Yiming didn't speak, so Xia Sang spoke first, "Master Liang, let me take you to rest."

As she spoke, Xia Sang hurriedly picked up Robles and was about to leave when Liang Yiming's voice came, "Xia Sang, don't avoid me."

Xia Sang stopped.

"I'm going to B City tomorrow," Liang Yiming continued, his voice calm and indifferent to Xia Sang's ears.

She'd only told him yesterday she wanted him to be with her, and today she was saying she was leaving.

Xia Sang's breath hitched. What did this mean? Was this some kind of joke?

"Xia Sang..."

"Grandpa Liang! Stop talking!" Xia Sang shouted, stunned even faster than Liang Yiming. He didn't mean to yell at Grandpa Liang; he just wanted him to stop talking, to stop disrupting his thoughts.

The peaceful conversation at Grandma Li's house today seemed like an illusion. Grandpa Liang always did what he wanted! Xia Sang tried to control her breathing.

Liang Yiming was genuinely surprised. Xia Sang had never spoken to him like this before, but he continued, "Xia Sang, do you want to come back with me?"

"Xia Sang, I need you."

"Are you willing?"

...
Am I willing? Xia Sang looked at Liang Yiming and asked himself the same question.

Grandpa Liang said he needed him.

Xia Sang didn't know why, but tears streamed down his face. He bit his lip, trying to keep a sound from coming out.

—"Do you need me?"

A year ago, Xia Sang had asked Grandpa Liang this. He thought that if Grandpa Liang spoke, if he needed him, it had to be him. He was willing to rush to his aid, even if he got hurt.

Now Grandpa Liang said he needed him.

Xia Sang covered his face with one hand and supported himself with the other. Grandpa Liang's features blurred before his eyes.

In that instant, he heard others calling him.

—Xia Sang, we have to deliver supplies tomorrow.

—Xia Xia, can you help fix the roof?

"—Brother Xia, can we stop filming anything too suggestive…?"

Xia Sang wiped his face, his voice a little hoarse. "Master Liang, I have to deliver supplies to Sister Juan tomorrow, Uncle Niu asked me to help repair the roof, and I also need to help with filming in Anyang, plus the documentary I'm shooting. I can't leave."

Xia Sang replied to Liang Yiming, "Master Liang, I can't leave."

*
The next day, G City Airport.

Liang Yiming followed the guide, Secretary Wang, to the first-class cabin of the plane. He sat on the plane, but his heart was unsettled. The darkness before him seemed especially chaotic.

The noise of the people around him was shut out by the chaos; only Xia Sang's voice echoed in his mind.

Xia Sang rejected him again.

He had clearly done exactly as Xia Sang had asked.

Yet he was still rejected.

Liang Yiming thought about it all night.

The roar of the plane taking off filled the air. The feeling of being suspended in mid-air, the force of ascent, suddenly pierced Liang Yiming's ears. His ears rang incessantly. He slightly opened his mouth, frowning as he adjusted. He hadn't experienced this much discomfort when flying before; now, the intense tinnitus even brought waves of dizziness.

Damn it.

Anger rose within Liang Yiming.

Damn it, damn it, damn it.

His anger seemed to find an outlet; the darkness before him seemed to dissipate, and the dawn light outside the window shone through the azure sky into Liang Yiming's eyes.

Blue, white, yellow.

Liang Yiming felt a stinging pain in his eyes.

Then... he could see.

Damn.

A few tears streamed down Liang Yiming's face from the stinging pain.

That night, Master Liang arrived in City B.

Xia Sang also learned that Master Liang could see again.

"Master Liang can see again?" Jin Ge looked at Xia Sang's phone screen; it was a message from Master Liang himself.

Jin Fulai carefully observed every expression on Xia Sang's face. "Xia Sang, is Master Liang coming back?"

"I don't know."

"What if Master Liang doesn't come back?" Jin Fulai looked at Xia Sang.

"..." Xia Sang was silent for a moment, then smiled, "Then he won't come back."

Jin Fulai was somewhat puzzled by Xia Sang's attitude.

"Xia Sang, do you think it's possible you don't actually like Grandpa Liang, and you're just grateful to him?"

"I'm definitely grateful to Grandpa Liang."

"Oh dear, I meant it, it's not liking him."

"How can it not be?" Xia Sang laughed and cried at the same time, "Can't I be grateful to Grandpa Liang and like him too?" Xia Sang peeled some peanuts for Jin Fulai, "How can you be so clear-cut?"

"Then you might meet someone you truly like in the future," Jin Fulai said anxiously.

"What's real and fake?" Xia Sang looked at Jin-ge curiously, "Jin-ge, do you like me?"

"What are you doing? I'm heterosexual." Jin Fulai hugged himself.

“Everything is real right now. If you don't cherish the person in front of you and keep thinking about other things, you'll regret it later.” Xia Sang seemed to be answering a different question. “I'm happy I met Grandpa Liang back then, even if we didn't end up together, it's still good.”

Xia Sang looked at the plump peanuts in her hand.

Love cannot be calculated, cannot be measured; it is complex, abundant, and joyful.

Like Grandpa and Grandma, like Teacher Huang, like Brother Jin and Xiao Hong, like Xingxing, like Grandpa Liang—even though he was just a lover, why force him to strive and grow? That was also Grandpa Liang's love.

And he loved each and every one of them deeply. He received love from them all; their love wasn't about possession, but about sharing.

There are so many other people here, and whether or not Grandpa Liang is there, he will be alright.
