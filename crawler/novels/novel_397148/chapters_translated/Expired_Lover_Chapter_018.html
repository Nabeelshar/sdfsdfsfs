Chapter 37, Part 18

A new week has begun.

Today was the day to film the second episode of "Intern Dad." All the celebrity guests departed from the company building to seamlessly connect with the end of the previous episode and film the preview short film for the second episode.

Xia Sang arrived at the company building early; Brother Jin was waiting for him in his office.

"Xia Sang, how did it go with Grandpa Liang?" Brother Jin asked. Xiao Hong pulled Xia Sang onto the sofa, a handful of sunflower seeds in her hand, looking like she was waiting for gossip.

"They didn't give me a bonus, nor a gift."

"Nothing? That's not right." Jin Fulai said, "I asked if something was going on when Grandpa Liang took you out for the first time."

Jin Fulai stared intently at Xia Sang's answer.

"No," Xia Sang shook her head. Returning from the neighboring city, he sensed an inexplicable change in Mr. Liang's attitude towards him, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.

He was a bit hazy about what happened that night, being drunk; he only remembered Mr. Liang taking off his gloves and touching his face.

When he woke up the next day, he asked Mr. Liang about it.

Mr. Liang said he just wanted to try, nothing more.

"Just a business trip?"

"Sigh, I thought you two had made progress," Xiao Hong chimed in. "But Mr. Liang only ever took you out."

Perhaps, he really did have a chance?

The embers of hope that had been extinguished in Xia Sang's heart flickered again.

"Alright, alright, that's enough, time's up," Jin reminded him. "Go downstairs first, don't be late and people will talk."

Jin pulled Xia Sang out, and in the elevator, there was another person inside who looked very familiar.

It was Bai Tinglin, the one who had stolen his gig before.

Jin and Xiao Hong, perhaps still holding a grudge about what happened last time, kept talking to him about the variety show.

"You did a good job last time, your popularity on Shenzhen TV doubled."

"And someone even did the editing for you."

Xia Sang glanced at him out of the corner of his eye. The boy looked at him, as if he wanted to say something.

Just then, the elevator stopped again, and another familiar face entered.

It was Xiao Lin and his manager. Xiao Lin's cold, downcast face transformed into the gentle smile Xia Sang knew so well when he saw the people in the elevator. After exchanging greetings and pleasantries, they quickly reached the first floor.

After exiting the elevator, Xia Sang turned back to look; the boy was still staring at her. What was wrong with him?

"He's just jealous," Jin Ge said, leaning over. "I heard he joined a film crew, but his acting wasn't great, and he got scolded."

"Ignore him, just focus on your variety show."

Several camera vans were parked at the entrance of Chenxing Building. Everyone stood at the entrance, and the host called out to the camera—

"Long time no see! Welcome everyone to episode 2 of 'Dear Intern Dad'!"

Comments:

First Floor: It's starting! It's starting!

2nd Floor: Ran Ge and Le Ge, we're here!

3rd Floor: I've come to see the babies!

4th Floor: I've come to see the fun! Xia Sang is so funny!

5th Floor: ...

"We can see our audience is very active! Let's go to the internship cabin and answer their questions along the way!"

"If you have any questions, type them in the chat. We'll randomly select some, and everyone has a chance."

Several people rode in the same car, the host holding an iPad, the screen displaying rapidly refreshing comments. "It seems everyone is very enthusiastic. We'll draw the first comment, and the first question will be asked to Teacher Huo Ran. If you want Teacher Huo Ran to answer, please send a comment!"

Draw successful—"Brother Ran, were you kidnapped on the variety show? How exactly did your manager threaten you? Tell us so we can have a good laugh."

The host couldn't help but laugh after reading it. "Huo Ran's fans are so humorous, hahaha!"

Huo Ran: ...

"I wasn't kidnapped. My manager told me to rest." Don't go out and argue.

Huo Ran didn't say the last sentence aloud.

The comments section was already bursting with laughter. Comments:

1st Floor: Who asked that! Who asked that! Well done!

2nd Floor: Who's so young to be forced to rest by their manager?

3rd Floor: I have to say, after appearing on the children's variety show, everyone finally realized our Ran Ge's low EQ. /facepalm.jpg

The quiz continued. The next person was Le Mingzhi, and the next one was Cong Hongfei. After they answered, the atmosphere in the entire live stream became lively.

The third person was Xiao Lin.

"Let's see what Mr. Siu Lam's question is—when will Siu Lam join a new production? We want to see his new drama!"

Siu Lam smiled, "Thank you for your concern, my dear fan. I'll be starting filming next month for a new drama directed by Yan. I hope everyone will come and support me then."

"Wow, good news right away! Congratulations!" "It's Teacher Xiao Lin."

Comments:

1st Floor: Director Yan's acting is great, congratulations!

2nd Floor: This question is a bit boring... Is there anything more exciting?

3rd Floor: @2nd Floor, it's a fan asking, non-fans shouldn't comment.

When it was Xia Sang's turn, the comments became even more enthusiastic. When the host announced the continuation of drawing questions, the comments surged even more dramatically.

Jin Fulai, following behind the production crew in their vehicle, felt something was off. "Xiao Hong, this comment surge is a bit strange."

Although Xia Sang attracts some casual viewers, these viewers aren't familiar with her; they're just there to watch, so they wouldn't ask so many questions.

Sure enough, as soon as the host announced the draw, Xia Sang's question was—"Xia Sang, don't you think your behavior on the variety show last time was a bit attention-seeking? It was a bit disgusting."

The preceding questions were either humorous or mild, making Xia Sang's question particularly sharp.

"This audience member is a bit too blunt," the host quickly smoothed things over. "Sometimes, the show needs to be a bit exaggerated for the audience's enjoyment."

Xia Sang looked gratefully at the host, a pretty young woman. "Thank you, host. I think as an artist, the audience is my god. How is that attention-seeking? I was thanking everyone for coming to support me, hahaha."

Comments:

1st Floor: Exactly, who asked this question?

2nd Floor: It's not like she's being overly dramatic, especially not in front of the kids.

3rd Floor: I think it's a bit strange on a children's variety show.

4th Floor: @3rd Floor, yeah, you think so.

The initially cheerful atmosphere was broken. Fans from other groups, especially some less favorable ones, blamed Xia Sang for the situation, feeling that Xia Sang was a troublemaker and a show-off. They felt they were just enjoying their idol's variety show, and Xia Sang was causing trouble instead. They openly and subtly supported Xia Sang's criticism.

The live chat started arguing.

The host, seeing that the five questions were finished, quickly put away the iPad, ending the event.

They began introducing the latest episode.

This time, they're not just staying at the cabin; tomorrow there's a two-day, one-night outdoor activity. The points the intern dads earned in the previous session can be used during the outdoor activity to redeem tents, outdoor gear, and more.

As they explained, they soon arrived at the villa cabin.

Several guest children had already arrived.

Xia Sang immediately spotted the old car parked to the side of the road. Xingxing was sitting inside, waving excitedly and calling out, "Brother Xia Sang!"

Xia Sang walked over, greeted the director who had brought Xingxing, and casually picked Xingxing up. "Hello, Xingxing."

"Hello, Brother Xia Sang!" Xingxing happily nuzzled Xia Sang, then took out a few chocolates and an origami piece from her pocket and handed them to him. "Brother Xia Sang, thank you for the gift. This is for you."

After the last program ended, Xia Shang donated a batch of supplies to Xingxing's orphanage. The director had told Xingxing about it, and Xingxing wanted to prepare a gift for Xia Sang too. After thinking for a long time, she finally decided to use her weekly favorite snacks—chocolate—and the drawing she learned from her teachers to draw a colored pencil picture for Xia Sang.

Above was a picture of Xia Sang holding Xingxing's hand, along with a large heart and childlike handwriting: Thank you, brother.

Seeing this, Xia Sang felt as if her heart was being bathed in warm water, and the sadness that had just welled up inside her subsided.

"Thank you, Xingxing."

Xia Sang gently hugged Xingxing.

*
After spending the night in the cabin, the next day after breakfast, the production crew set off for a clearing near the villa area.

This was a clearing that the production crew had done during their rest period.

Upon arriving at the location, the first step was to exchange points for items, including tents, food, and outdoor tools.

Xingxing watched the host explain that because they had come in last place twice, their points were only enough to redeem the simplest tent, not even anything else.

Xingxing pouted sadly, "Brother Xia Sang, I didn't let you stay in the big tent."

"It's okay."

Xia Sang comforted Xingxing, but Xingxing looked at the other tents with a disappointed expression.

Xia Sang softly asked him, and as he listened, Xia Sang realized that Xingxing wasn't envious, but rather a little insecure and sensitive. He felt he wasn't the best kid, always coming in last, and he felt lost and guilty towards Brother Xia Sang.

Xia Sang couldn't help but hug Xingxing.

"We'll try harder next time. Last time Brother Xia Sang wasn't here, but this time I am, and we definitely won't be last again."

Xia Sang promised.

Therefore, Xia Sang took the activity very seriously when the production team announced it. Besides, they didn't have enough points to redeem for food, and they had to work hard for his and Xingxing's lunch!

"The first outdoor activity is carrying water using banana leaves. It's very simple. Each intern dad and child will be in a team, and whoever carries the most water in five minutes wins!"

The production team then brought out two large buckets and a 1.5-meter-long, 20-centimeter-high log bridge. The round trip to fetch water is about 3 meters, and the children and intern dads take turns crossing the log bridge.

After the production team finished explaining, the set was set up, and everyone was given a banana leaf of roughly the same size.

The water-carrying order followed the winners of the last competition, and Xia Sang was last again this time.

First up were Le Mingzhi and Dou Dou, who had won first place last time.

This time, Le Mingzhi was agile, and his speed and water-carrying volume were quite good. However, the children's small hands made it slow, and if they weren't steady, the water would spill, ruining their chances.

So, this round clearly relied on the adults.

Dou Dou from Le Mingzhi's group walked steadily, but slowly, and some water was spilled. Fortunately, Le Mingzhi's speed was good, and the 5 minutes passed quickly, with a decent amount of water carried.

After the first guest finished, Xiao Lin and his group carried water very quickly. Zhuangzhuang, being the oldest of the children, walked the most steadily, and Xiao Lin, with his good balance, quickly surpassed Le Mingzhi to become number one.

Next were Huo Ran and Rou Rou. Huo Ran did well, but Rou Rou was rather timid. She tripped and fell on the log bridge, crying for a long time. Huo Ran had to comfort her before she got up and continued, resulting in a less than satisfactory outcome. Le Mingzhi laughed at Huo Ran again.

Fourth were Cong Hongfei and Tao Tao. Last time, Tao Tao and he were like ADHD, almost falling during their three-legged race. Fortunately, they performed well this time, advancing to second place.

Finally, Xia Sang cheered herself on, determined to win first place for Xingxing this time.

During the earlier rounds, he had been observing closely. If Xingxing wanted to win, he needed to increase his speed. Xingxing was young, unlike Zhuangzhuang, and his hands were small, so he couldn't carry much water.

If he could walk faster, he could make two more trips and might win.

So Xia Sang folded a banana leaf into a small funnel and gave it to Xingxing.

"Xingxing, we don't need to fill it too much. We need to walk quickly, but steadily, so we don't fall and get hurt," Xia Sang explained carefully to Xingxing, who nodded attentively.

This small funnel held less water, but it was less likely to leak when a child held it, making it easier for him to walk.

This gave him a chance to make one or two more trips, allowing him to replenish the water.

Moreover, he was in the last group, so his advantage was that he knew how much water the current leader had, giving him a target to chase.

“Let’s try our best to win together!”

Xingxing nodded excitedly.

The timer started—

Xingxing listened to Xia Sang very well. After filling the bucket with water, she ran forward, carefully watching her steps as she crossed the small bridge, without falling even once.

Xia Sang, too, had been running around doing chores since childhood, so she had excellent stamina and ran back and forth quickly.

The water in the bucket gradually increased.

She started overtaking Huo Ran, Le Mingzhi, and Cong Hongfei, steadily closing in on Xiao Lin.

Xiao Lin’s group had a lot of water, and since Xingxing hadn’t carried as much as Zhuangzhuang, Xia Sang still needed to keep chasing, but time was running out!

In the final seconds, on the last round trip, Xia Sang was just a hair's breadth away. If only he had a little more water, they would have won.

Just a hair's breadth.

Just a hair's breadth.

But time was running out.

Xia Sang thought of Xingxing, aimed, and lunged forward, splashing water all over the bucket. Some water spilled, but luckily the bucket's opening was big enough to hold a lot!

They'd made it!!!

"Ahhh!" Xingxing shouted, "We made it!"

Xingxing smiled so happily for the first time.

Xia Sang stumbled in front of the bucket. He got up, the ground covered in mud from the water spill, his body and face caked with mud.

Xingxing rushed over, and after Xia Sang assured him it was alright, he didn't mind getting dirty and jumped into Xia Sang's arms, "Brother Xia Sang, we really won!"

"Yes, we won."

Comments:

1st Floor: So competitive! So competitive!

2nd Floor: Haha, that's what makes it fun!

3rd Floor: Xingxing is smiling so happily!

4th Floor: I really get the father-son dynamic between Xia Sang and Xingxing, haha!

The next few outdoor activities were practically Xia Sang's comfort zone; he was always first or second, making Xingxing incredibly happy, and Xia Sang also had a great time.

Their points accumulated, and each group could exchange them for enough food.

That evening, everyone gathered around the campfire to grill food.

Recording will continue early tomorrow morning. After that, they can go back to the cabin to record for another day, and then the second episode will be over.

Perhaps because the outdoor activities had exhausted the children, the intern dads seemed much more relaxed this time.

Xiao Lin absentmindedly ate a couple of bites, feeling his phone vibrate in his pocket. He greeted it, leaving the live stream camera focused on Zhuangzhuang.

He walked away, the message on his phone—["You're really useless. Forget it, I don't need you anymore."]

Xiao Lin clutched the phone tightly, repeatedly pondering the meaning of the sentence.

Was it telling him he didn't need to cause trouble on the variety show anymore, or was it telling him he didn't need to come anymore?

If it was telling him he didn't need to come anymore, what should he do?

His only bargaining chip with Liang Yize was that he had once been Liang's mistress, even a mistress with whom he had had intimate relationships.

But that was a lie.

He had indeed been Liang's mistress, but he and Bai Tinglin were no different.

Three years ago, he finally waited until that agent was arrested.

He had already taken his phone and computer, so why wouldn't he let him go?

He turned his head and looked at Xia Sang, who was holding Xingxing.

They were so alike, why were some people so lucky?

Xiao Lin felt a throbbing pain in his heart.

He knew Liang Yize was just playing with him. What would he do without Liang Yize?

He walked in front of Xia Sang's tent, lost in thought, but he hadn't made a move yet.

He saw something crawl into Xia Sang's tent.

His heart pounded, and he opened his mouth, but couldn't utter a word.

He returned to the camera at the meeting point, pulled Zhuang Zhuang up, and led him back to their tent. Before going in, he nervously checked the tent flap.

Xiao Lin: "I read online that it's always good to check everything before going into a camping spot at night."

That night, everyone happily went into their tents to rest and prepared to turn off the live stream.

Unexpectedly, they had barely lain down when they heard Xia Sang shout, "Help! Xingxing has been bitten by a snake!"
