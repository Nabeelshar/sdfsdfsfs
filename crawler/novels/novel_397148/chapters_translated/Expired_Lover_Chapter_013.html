Chapter 32 13 Variety Show (Part Two)

Xia Sang was still thinking about how to solve the problem when he suddenly felt someone grab his clothes.

The little boy, who hadn't said much the whole way, grabbed his clothes and said, "Brother Xia Sang, did I make you come in last place?"

He looked down; Xingxing's beautiful almond-shaped eyes were moist, and his little lips were pursed, as if he was about to cry.

"No, Xingxing," Xia Sang patted Xingxing's head, comforting him, "It's just a game, let's not worry about the rankings, okay? Brother is happy to see Xingxing."

Xingxing looked at Xia Sang stubbornly.

Xia Sang had no choice but to gently pick him up, lift him high, and take him inside his mouth with a "woof woof."

Lifting him high can make any child's worries fly away, that's what Grandma said.

Unfortunately, he grew up too fast; Feifei didn't get to enjoy his childhood for many years before he was all grown up.

He carried Xingxing into the house and saw that everyone else was already waiting in the living room.

Four guests and four children entered. Xiao Lin stood up first to greet them, "Xia Sang, come, sit here."

Xia Sang smiled warmly, "Thank you, Teacher Xiao." She sat down after Xiao Lin. Xiao Lin then introduced the others to Xia Sang, "You arrived late and missed the self-introductions,"

He held the hand of a tall, sturdy little boy, "This is my intern, you can call him Zhuangzhuang."

Pointing to Le Mingzhi and Huo Ran, "These are Le Mingzhi and Huo Ran. They're with two girls, Dou Dou and Rou Rou."

There was also Cong Hongfei and his little guest, Tao Tao.

Xia Sang greeted everyone one by one and introduced Xingxing to them.

Everyone clapped in a friendly manner, but the atmosphere wasn't very lively.

After everyone had finished introducing themselves, the host quickly came out and began the next round of activities. "Welcome everyone to our internship cabin. Now, I'll read out a few rules..."

"First, please open your suitcases." As soon as the host finished speaking, staff took out the celebrities' and children's luggage.

"For this episode, besides some daily necessities, all other toys, snacks, and wallets must be handed in."

The host had barely finished speaking.

Rou Rou choked up, "Uncle, you can't take Rou Rou's little bunny!" Her eyes reddened, and she burst into tears, "My little bunny is Rou Rou's best friend!"

Huo Ran, who was in charge of Rou Rou, took a step back in shock.

Comments:

1st Floor: Hahahaha, I'm dying of laughter! Huo-ge, are you really going to take a step back?

2nd Floor: The most classic and terrifying opening scene of this children's reality show.

Zhuangzhuang and Taotao brought a lot of snacks, especially Taotao, who brought a huge bag of chocolates. Seeing he couldn't carry the chocolates away, he sat down and started eating them, his mouth agape revealing quite a few cavities.

Cong Hongfei was frantically pacing around, trying to stop him. Taotao cleverly said, "Hongfei-gege, I didn't cry, right? Shouldn't I get chocolate as a reward for being such a good boy?" This left Cong Hongfei speechless.

Dou Dou was very obedient, with big, bright eyes. Le Mingzhi helped her take out her toy, and after a little coaxing, she obediently handed it over. She even kept pulling on Le Mingzhi's little finger and snuggling close to him, making him squint his eyes with cuteness.

Xingxing's luggage was very simple; besides a doll, there was nothing else. Xia Sang explained it to him, and although he was reluctant to take it, he still took it out.

Comments:

1st Floor: The children Lele and Xia Sang brought are all very well-behaved. Tao Tao is going to make me laugh to death, haha.

2nd Floor: Dou Dou clearly has good upbringing; the children at Xingxing Orphanage are definitely obedient.

3rd Floor: Was she rinsing her mouth in the toilet upstairs? Although I don't know Xia Sang well, the child is innocent.

4th Floor: Are you crazy? There are already haters right after the show started…

It was a chaotic scene. Xia Sang picked up Xingxing and sat her on the sofa. Rourou was still crying, and Huo Ran couldn't soothe her at all.

Xingxing looked up and asked Xia Sang if he could comfort his sister.

Xia Sang nodded.

Xingxing took small steps to Rourou and squatted down in front of her. The two little bundles of joy huddled together. Xingxing encouraged Rourou, saying things like she was a "brave princess" and "my little bear will stay with the bunny." Rourou's eyes were red, but she finally stopped crying.

Xia Sang smiled. It's always the kids who know how to comfort other kids.

He glanced at Huo Ran and smiled at him. Huo Ran didn't see him, but Xiao Lin noticed and immediately said, "Teacher Huo Ran, thankfully Xingxing helped you soothe Xiao Rou."

Huo Ran paused, looked at him, then glanced at Xia Sang and nodded.

So aloof.

Xia Sang thought, while giving Xiao Lin a smile.

"After you've packed up, please come and collect your three-day allowance." The host took out an envelope containing 500 yuan. "Please use this allowance to spend time with your children in the cabin."

"What if we run out?" Xiao Lin asked.

"Then you fathers will need to find ways to earn money yourselves, either by working or completing tasks," the host said.

This clearly meant they would need to earn money themselves later.

Finally, the host added, "Because Teacher Xia Sang was the last to arrive, there's a small punishment. Teacher Xia Sang was the last to choose a room, and she'll also be responsible for cleaning the house tomorrow morning."

Everyone's eyes turned to Xia Sang, who nodded without objection.

Xingxing raised her hand in Xia Sang's arms and said, "I can help Brother Xia."

"Thank you, Xingxing," Xia Sang said, gently pinching Xingxing's cheek.

When it came time to choose rooms, Xiao Lin suddenly suggested, "How about we draw lots? Even though Xia Sang arrived last, he's really too far away; it's not fair."

Cong Feihong glanced at Xia Sang. "We can draw lots in order, but he's being punished, so let's not do that."

The program had arranged four rooms: three upstairs, one downstairs, and the rest were locked.

The downstairs room was noticeably smaller than the upstairs one and closer to the kitchen; it was probably the villa's maid's room.

Cong Feihong didn't want to stay in this room. If he could just kick Xia Sang out, the rest of them could stay upstairs.

"This…" Xiao Lin looked at Xia Sang for help.

Comments:

1st Floor: Game rules are rules, okay?

2nd Floor: Bad luck, whose fault is it?

3rd Floor: Xiao Lin is such a nice guy.

4th Floor: This saint should just go live on the first floor herself.

5th Floor: Xiao Lin and Xia Sang might know each other, right? Xiao Lin is so loyal.

"You're so considerate of him, why don't you just give him your room?" Cong Feihong couldn't stand Xiao Lin's dawdling. Cong Feihong rolled his eyes inwardly, speechless. He couldn't stand this kind of fake innocent, thinking he was the director's son. His own father was already in jail for contract disputes.

"Then I..." Xiao Lin hadn't finished speaking.

Xia Sang spoke up, "No need, let's follow the program's rules."

The rest of the group quickly assigned rooms.

Xiao Lin approached Xia Sang and whispered, "Teacher Xia Sang, if you'd like, I can switch rooms with you."

Xiao Lin was wearing a white shirt and jeans today, his hair dyed dark brown, and he had a slight smile on his face, looking like a steady and reliable senior from a TV drama.

Xia Sang was somewhat flattered; he had never met such a kind colleague before.

He inexplicably bowed and thanked them, and Xingxing, bewildered, followed Xia Sang's bow, even putting her hands together in a gesture of respect.

The two's antics made Xiao Lin laugh. "Haha."

Comments:

1st Floor: Wow, Xiao Lin is so nice!

2nd Floor: Xiao Lin has really grown up. His resources were so bad a few years ago, thankfully he's doing better now.

3rd Floor: Xia Sang and Xingxing always make me laugh to death.

4th Floor: Isn't this wrong? It violates the rules!

5th Floor: The production team didn't stop them, it's nothing, just a little kid, why so many rules?

The comments continued to be heated.

The production team could be heard saying on the screen, "Unless there are special circumstances, guests are not allowed to change rooms at will."

Xiao Lin could only look at Xia Sang apologetically.

“It’s alright, Teacher Xiao, my sleep quality is great. How about Xingxing?” Xia Sang asked Xingxing. Xingxing tilted her head. “Xingxing is asleep, even the monster can’t wake her.”

“That’s great,” Xia Sang praised Xingxing.

“Okay, if there’s anything else, tell me.” Xiao Lin reached out and stroked Xingxing’s soft hair. “Let’s help each other out.”

Xia Sang smiled as he watched Xiao Lin’s retreating figure. He had only met Xiao Lin once, yet Xiao Lin was so kind to him. Handsome, gentle, and a really good person.

“Okay, then our program crew will be leaving now. We’ll be handing it over to the intern dads and their children.”

With that, the host and crew left one after another.

Comments:

1st Floor: The first night has begun.

2nd Floor: Hopefully everything's alright? I both hope nothing's wrong and hope something happens, hehe.

3rd Floor: Looking at Huo Ran's flustered state, how dare he go on this little variety show?

4th Floor: Trying to whitewash his image. A veteran, black-faced celebrity, resorting to using kids to whitewash his image, disgusting.

5th Floor: Don't be so foul-mouthed upstairs.

That night, in the innermost room on the second floor, Xiao Lin gently covered Zhuangzhuang with a blanket. After tucking him in, he couldn't help but laugh.

Those kids made a ruckus all night, exhausting everyone. Seven more days to go, they're going to cause quite a commotion.

Thinking about this, he suddenly heard a "beep" from his bedside table—his phone's special notification ringtone.

He looked up and saw the security camera had already shut down. He picked up his phone, went to the small balcony, and opened it. It was a text message from Liang Yize—[Well done tonight, keep it up.]

Meanwhile, in a lavish venue, Liang Yiming accepted a drink from his business partner.

"Mr. Liang, the new drug's clinical trials have passed. I hope our batch of drugs can be approved as soon as possible."

General Manager Chen calculated that although he had invested a lot upfront, if the drug approval came through, he could just sit back and collect the money. It was just a pity he hadn't trusted Ye Bin enough and invested too little.

Ye Bin was smart; it's a shame he wasn't here tonight.

Mr. Chen heard that Liang Yiming's mistress had apparently broken up with him and hadn't found anyone yet.

He glanced at his secretary privately.

Has she found anyone?

The secretary gestured "OK."

Mr. Chen beamed. He had met Liang Yiming's mistress before, and this was a surprise for Mr. Liang. He'd like to bring him along again if there were any good opportunities like this.

After a few rounds of drinks, Liang Yiming arrived at the hotel room with his assistant. Before they even reached the room, they saw a young man standing there. He had black hair, wore a white shirt and black pants, and looked simple and clean.

A text message also appeared on his phone.

[Mr. Liang, stay here tonight. I've arranged someone for you. If you like him, keep him; if not, let him go.] Looking at the boy, Liang Yiming suddenly felt as if he had traveled back two years to when he second saw Xia Sang. It was also at a cocktail party; he had walked out of the party and immediately recognized the boy who had handed him water in the theater.

He was following someone, and then someone else approached him.

"Did you come here voluntarily?" Liang Yiming asked Xia Sang, who nodded.

At that moment, Liang Yiming felt a strange sense of loss. Afterward, he looked at Xia Sang with a selective gaze, and finally, he tried.

Liang Yiming lay on the hotel sofa, his tall, muscular frame taut over the seams of his shirt. He lowered his head and lit a cigarette. Thinking of Xia Sang, he suddenly felt a strong urge to embrace her again.

He was breathing heavily, a cigarette dangling from his lips, and looked up at the boy standing in the living room. The boy glanced at him nervously, and he beckoned.

The boy walked up to Liang Yiming.

"Hold out your hand," Liang Yiming said.

The boy extended his hands; they were fair, with well-defined knuckles, unlike some other person's rough hands, which bore a scar on their palm.

He grasped the boy's hand; the soft touch should have eased his desire.

But in reality, he felt even more itchy, from bone to fingertips, and anger rose within Liang Yiming.

He utterly loathed this vague, intangible illness.

It was making him unlike himself.

How could someone like him have such a weakness?

"It hurts." A cry rang in Liang Yiming's ears. The boy's slightly shrunken body was exposed before Liang Yiming's eyes. He released the other's hand.

He said to his assistant, "You all get out."

The boy wanted to say something, but was escorted out by the assistant.

Leaving behind Master Liang.

Itchy.

Still itchy.
