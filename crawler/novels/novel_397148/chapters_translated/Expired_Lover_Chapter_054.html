Chapter 78, 53 Kissing Moments

After the man ran away, the crowd dispersed. Xia Sang followed closely beside Liang Yiming, explaining what each stall had to offer. Chen Anyang joined in, playfully teasing and joking with Xia Sang.

The sun slowly rose. After strolling through the market, they came across a small supermarket on the street. Xia Sang asked, "Do you want some popsicles?"

"I want some," Chen Anyang replied immediately.

"And that one?" Xia Sang asked.

"Yes," Chen Anyang said, giving an OK sign.

Their conversation revealed a tacit understanding that Liang Yiming was unaware of.

“Grandpa Liang, what flavor would you like?” Xia Sang stood on the steps, looking down at Liang Yiming as she asked. After asking, she suddenly realized she'd never seen Grandpa Liang eat these things before. Back at the villa, he was the only one who liked buying snacks, and even then, he didn't seem to have any particular preference for any particular flavor.

Xia Sang waited a while before hearing Grandpa Liang's reply.

“…Original.”

Original flavor ice cream, just the most common milk flavor, right?

Xia Sang went inside.

Leaving Liang Yiming and Chen Anyang standing at the doorway, the air conditioner blasting cold air. Chen Anyang looked at Liang Yiming; the man stood by the roadside, his back straight, holding a black white cane, exuding a natural air.

Chen Anyang was usually a very cheerful and talkative person, but at this moment he didn't want to speak. It wasn't about discriminating against Liang Yiming's body, but rather that Chen Anyang almost instinctively disliked Liang Yiming, sensing a strong aversion to him.

A silence fell between them. After a while, surprisingly, Liang Yiming spoke first.

"You like Xia Sang?" Liang Yiming asked.

A cold wind brushed against his cheek, and Chen Anyang's heart skipped a beat. His breathing quickened. He looked around; seeing no one, he stiffened his neck and said, "Yes, I have feelings for Xia Sang."

Liang Yiming's face first turned cold upon hearing this, then he said casually, "You're an only child, aren't you?"

"How did you know?" Chen Anyang asked nervously.

"I asked."

"That's none of your business."

"Does your family know you're gay?"

Chen Anyang was startled by this question. "I'm not... I just like Xia Sang."

"Don't talk about me, rich people like you care more about these things!" Chen Anyang frowned and shouted. “I know you live alone.”

Not only Liang Yiming, but Chen Anyang also secretly searched for Liang Yiming online. He felt Liang Yiming looked familiar when they first met, and he only intended to try, but unexpectedly, he actually found something.

He even found some gossip news, and Xia Sang even appeared in it, though the online information was scarce and vague. He could only roughly guess their relationship. Chen Anyang recalled his first encounter with Xia Sang.

She had been robbed in the county town, standing pitifully in the rain outside the police station.

"You just made things difficult for him, didn't you?" Chen Anyang said angrily. These rich people really didn't treat others like human beings. "Why are you coming to find Brother Xia Sang again? Do you think he's easy to bully?"

Xia Sang's good temper was well-known.

Liang Yiming leaned on his cane, standing straight, his eyes slightly lowered, his expression unreadable.

Chen Anyang felt a lump in his throat, wanting to say something.

Xia Sang returned.

"What were you two talking about?" Xia Sang asked curiously as she came out carrying a bag. Seeing the two men standing there looking unhappy, she asked, "An Yang, did you two have a fight?"

"...No, we just chatted for a bit," Chen An Yang mumbled. "I'm hot."

Hearing this, Xia Sang quickly handed Chen An Yang his taro-flavored ice cream cone.

Chen An Yang happily took the cone. "It's my favorite taro flavor."

"Mmm-hmm," Xia Sang replied, then took out a popsicle, peeled off the wrapper, wrapped the stick in two or three layers of tissue paper, and placed the popsicle in Liang Ye's hand.

"Let's finish eating before we go," Xia Sang said, stuffing the popsicle into her mouth herself, and then, holding Liang Yiming's hand, sat down on the plastic stool by the shop entrance.

Chen Anyang sat down on Xia Sang's other side, seemingly oblivious to her surroundings. "Xia Sang, I..."

Before Xia Sang could finish, she felt Liang Ye tug at her sleeve. "Xia Sang, can you check if my popsicle has melted?"

Xia Sang quickly checked and found it had indeed melted a little. "Liang Ye, move your finger a little bit more."

Xia Sang pressed Liang Ye's finger against the end of the stick. "I wrapped it in tissue paper. It's hot, hurry up and eat it."

"Mmm," Liang Yiming responded with a nasal tone, lowering his head to eat his popsicle.

Xia Sang looked at Liang Ye and suddenly felt like laughing. Liang Ye probably had never eaten a popsicle in a place like this before; he looked rather adorable.

Thinking this, Xia Sang munched on her own popsicle.

Chen Anyang ate his ice cream cone with his head down, glaring resentfully at Liang Yiming, who appeared calm and collected on the surface.

(Inwardly cursing, "Green tea.")

Night, bedroom.

After washing up, Liang Yiming sat on the edge of the bed, hearing Xia Sang rustling as she changed into her pajamas. Once dressed, she came to his side and touched his hair.

"Grandpa Liang, why didn't you dry your hair today?" Xia Sang touched Liang's damp hair, then picked up the hairdryer from the bedside table and slowly dried it bit by bit. "Wet hair makes it hard to sleep."

Liang Yiming softly hummed in agreement.

Xia Sang felt Liang Yiming was acting strangely today. Ever since he was scammed that morning, something about him hadn't quite clicked.

Liang's hair was short, and Xia Sang dried it quickly. He stood up to tidy himself up.

Liang Yiming felt an itch on his body the moment Xia Sang left.

Why was Xia Sang being so nice to him?

He liked him.

"Xia Sang."

"Hmm?" Xia Sang turned around when he heard Liang Yiming call him. "What's wrong?"

"Come here," Liang Yiming said. "Sit here."

Xia Sang, puzzled, approached and sat down next to Liang Yiming.

Liang Yiming's hand moved twice in the air before grasping Xia Sang's arm. He traced the line down Xia Sang's arm to her neck and face. Because of his blindness, Liang Yiming's movements were gentle. He stroked her eyes and cheeks, then gently touched her lips before suddenly kissing her.

The intense itching subsided in that instant.

He bit Xia Sang's lips; they were warm, soft, and minty. He couldn't help but say,

"Xia Sang, come back."

"Come back, we'll be the same as before."
