Chapter 42, Part 23: Xia Sang

Grandma had once told Xia Sang that he was a foundling.

It was a cold winter day. Grandma Xia heard his cries in a haystack while scavenging for scraps. There was no one around. Grandma brought him home.

“Oh, old man,” Grandma Xia said, looking at the small, thin baby on the bed with fondness, “I found a child.”

“Where did he come from?” Grandpa Xia lay on the bed, his lower body thin and hidden under an old quilt. “Take him to the police station.”

“No one’s here.” A small glimmer of light gathered in Grandma Xia’s gray eyes. Grandpa Xia saw her thoughts and sighed inwardly. They had once had a son, but he had a genetic disease. They had worked tirelessly, traveling far and wide, but they still couldn’t save his life.

Not only that, Grandpa Xia also injured his spine while working on a construction site, rendering him unable to walk. His unscrupulous boss kept delaying payment of the compensation that was rightfully his. The two of them squeezed into a small shack, doing odd jobs, while Grandma Xia collected recyclables and swept the streets.

“If someone else loses their child here, we’ll be the ones who did something wrong!” Grandpa Xia said sternly.

“I was there, waiting all afternoon, but no one came.” Grandma Xia hugged the child tightly, as if to say, “You can’t fool me.” “If I hadn’t saved the child, he would have frozen to death.”

“Ah.” The child, slightly more alert after drinking, cried out, perhaps understanding.

Decades of hardship were temporarily forgotten before the child, and tenderness filled the hearts of the two elderly people.

Grandpa Xia softened a bit. "You can't just take someone else's child."

"I know, I know," Grandma Xia waved her hands repeatedly. Every day, she would take the child and some dry food and go early to the place where she found the child, but for several days, no one came.

When Grandma Xia went to buy groceries, she would ask around to see if anyone had lost a child.

No, this child seemed like a gift from heaven.

After half a month, they finally decided to adopt the child. They even had a disagreement about how to address him.

"This child came to find us," Grandma Xia said.

“From now on, the baby will be our son,” Grandpa Xia said with a smile.

“Pah, who would want such an ugly, old father? People would laugh at us,” Grandma Xia patted Grandpa Xia’s thin, bony shoulder.

They were both in their early forties, but the years had etched them with age, making them look at least ten years older than their actual age.

“And I already have a son, now I’m going to have a grandson,” Grandma Xia said, holding the baby high in her arms. “This is my grandson…”

Grandma Xia especially loved Gesang flowers. Her son was named Xia Ge, so naturally, her grandson would be named—“Xia Sang.”

And so, Xia Sang became their grandson.

Even when Xia Sang was very young, he knew that the family was poor.

His classmates were all dressed much neater and more refined than him, making the young boy feel inferior. Fortunately, Xia Sang met a good teacher in elementary school.

She inquired about Xia Sang's situation at home. After learning about it, she asked, "Have you applied for school subsidies? And welfare?"

Xia Sang shook his head.

Because Xia Sang's grandparents weren't locals and had limited education, they didn't know many things. Even their household registration was handled by the son of an aunt at the market.

When Xia Sang's grandparents were asked about their child, they became extremely nervous.

In their minds, the child they had found was theirs, and orphanages weren't good places; they'd heard they were abusive.

They claimed the child was their grandson, but without a birth certificate, registration was illegal. They went through a great deal of trouble to finally adopt Xia Sang.

With a child, their lives had hope.

Even Grandpa Xia's handicrafts became faster; they wanted to give their grandson a better environment.

But fate always seems to cut where the hemp rope is thinnest.

Grandpa Xia suddenly started having frequent fevers, his lower limbs developed ulcers, requiring medication, and eventually his mental state deteriorated.

What used to be a meager income for Grandpa Xia now became the family's payment bill.

Most of the time, Grandpa Xia was frugal with his medicine, but the accumulating expenses made their already meager family even poorer, and the cost of living was skyrocketing.

They had considered leaving, but their hometown was just a remote mountain valley.

They wanted Xia Sang to study and live in this better city, the city where he was born and raised.

Grandpa Xia endured the pain, Grandma Xia scrimped and saved, and Xia Sang ate sparingly.

Ten-year-old Xia Sang was as thin as a seven or eight-year-old.

After the new female teacher's home visit, she cried uncontrollably, hugging Xia Sang and saying, "I'll help you."

She helped Xia Sang apply for school subsidies and even asked someone to help with the procedures for low-income assistance, bringing a glimmer of hope to Xia Sang's family.

Xia Sang liked this teacher very much, and therefore studied even harder.

Unfortunately, not long after, the teacher was transferred to another job. She left Xia Sang her phone number, saying he could contact her if he encountered any difficulties.

Xia Sang even saved up money to make phone calls from a phone booth. He told her he missed his teacher, that the new teacher was different from her, and that she didn't like him.

The teacher would encourage Xia Sang on the phone.

Unfortunately, Xia Sang started school late, and his learning speed often lagged behind. He was criticized and made to stand as punishment, which further slowed his progress.

But thankfully, with the encouragement of his teachers, Xia Sang still studied diligently.

However, one week, he couldn't get through to his teacher by phone.

Xia Sang tried many times, and finally one day the call was answered. It was an elderly woman's voice.

"Hello, I'm looking for Teacher Xu. I'm her student."

Upon hearing Xia Sang's youthful voice, the woman suddenly burst into tears.

That kind Teacher Huang had lost her child to drowning in another province. Teacher Huang's mother had come to the rented apartment to pack her things; this was her last visit.

Xia Sang doesn't remember how he cried his way home. His grandparents were still figuring out how to teach him about parting, but he had already quietly experienced it all.

Even then, because it was so far away, he never had the chance to visit his teacher.

A few years later, Xia's grandfather also passed away. He had struggled to stay healthy for a long time, but before he died, he had become extremely thin.

Because he was frugal, he only took half a pill at a time in his medication, and he passed away before finishing it, just that summer.

Grandpa Xia's passing left Grandma Xia without a smile for a long time. One day, however, she perked up again, patting Xia Sang's head. "Sang Sang, everything will pass. We must be good to each other, and be as happy as we were when Grandpa was here."

Xia Sang could only hug her tightly, bursting into tears once more.

Several years passed, and Xia Sang and Grandma Xia worked tirelessly to get him into high school, sending him off to school.

But the high school students' clothes were far more exquisite and beautiful than those of his previous classmates.

Xia Sang felt even more out of place here.

The classmate just across the aisle from him bought a water bottle that cost an unimaginable amount to him.

"It's so beautiful." Xia Sang spoke to the girl for the first time; she was a delicate, fragrant young woman. She had brought back a cup this week, filled with beautiful blue stones outlining dreamlike patterns. Xia Sang fell in love with it at first sight. He asked shyly, "How much is this?"

"Well, you probably can't afford it, it's a bit expensive," the girl said. "My mother brought it back from abroad. It has gemstones inside, it's about nine hundred yuan."

After the girl stated the price, the others surrounding her chattered and offered her gifts. Xia Sang retreated shyly.

Xia Sang could only look at it from afar, something so close yet something he might never be able to afford, something he couldn't bear to buy.

But then, during PE class that afternoon, the nearly thousand-yuan cup was broken.

The classroom security cameras were just for show; there were no surveillance records.

No one knew whether it was an accident or sabotage.

The girl was furious but helpless. She lay on her desk and cried until school ended, her eyes still red.

Xia Sang wanted to comfort her but didn't dare go in.

The next day, when Xia Sang returned to school, he heard a rumor.

—Xia Sang broke Chen Anni's super expensive water cup.

—Because he liked it a lot, and he was poor.

Without any concrete evidence, just a few judgments, the rumor spread like wildfire.

Everyone pointed and whispered about him, even the teachers talked to him.

He tried to defend himself, "I didn't. I went to PE class with everyone."

The others said,

—PE class has free time; who knows if he came back?

—Or maybe after they all left PE class, Xia Sang secretly came back and accidentally or deliberately broke it.

Any explanation, the onlookers could find another.

Xia Sang's weak voice couldn't pierce through the prejudice. Just then, Grandma Xia collapsed from anemia.

He and his grandmother were left alone at home, and Xia Sang wanted to shoulder the responsibility.

He left school and went to work at a small restaurant he passed every day on his way to and from school.

Although the restaurant owner was tough and strong, she was genuinely kind to Xia Sang, saving many clean leftovers for him to take home.

Over the past two years, Xia Sang's malnutrition was gradually replenished, and he finally began to grow taller and his features matured, his handsome features becoming increasingly striking.

One day on his way to work, Xia Sang rescued a struggling extra. The extra visited Xia Sang's home, bringing him plenty of fruit. Noticing Xia Sang's family's financial difficulties, the extra suggested, "Why don't you act with me?"

The extra said, "Although extra work doesn't pay much, you're good-looking. Acting will earn you more than working at that small restaurant."

Xia Sang hesitated. He was very grateful to the restaurant owner and his wife for their help.

Unexpectedly, the proprietress was even more excited than him, urging him to give it a try. "Little brother! Why are you turning down such a good opportunity? You're as handsome as a star. Once you become a big star, this little shop of mine will be booming thanks to you!"

The proprietress's rapid-fire delivery sounded like rap, making everyone laugh.

After that, Xia Sang started working with the extras in theaters, often jumping between different productions. Although he played cannon fodder or even corpses, he slowly saved some money.

Xia Sang often treated the extras to meals at the proprietress's place. He remembered one time, Xia Sang had also had a few drinks and, slightly tipsy, said he had savings and wanted to enroll in a skill class to provide a better life for his grandmother.

Not only that, he also received an invitation from a talent agent that day, which his older brother helped him vet.

Several agents had approached him before, but his brother had always dismissed them as no-name agencies or even shady studios, and Xia Sang had refused them all.

But this time, his older brother, also quite drunk, patted Xia Sang on the back. "This is a turning point! Morning Star is a big company, give it a try! Give it a try!"

Just when everything seemed to be turning around...

His older brother told Xia Sang to go home early. When Xia Sang got home, he found his grandmother had collapsed on the floor.

Xia Sang rushed his grandmother to the hospital. It was a stroke, and she appeared to have other problems as well, requiring further examination.

The doctor presented him with a stack of bills and asked him to pay.

Thinking of this, Xia Sang looked at Jin Ge, who was still muttering to himself, and couldn't help but smile faintly.

After paying the first installment, he gradually ran out of money. He borrowed from the landlady and the extras, and finally, when all else failed, he even shamelessly asked the agent who had promised to make him a big star.

One phone call later, the agent drove over and paid for him, asking with concern, "Is your grandma alright?"

Jin Fulai wasn't pregnant yet at that time. He sighed, "He said he'd make you a star, but it might not work out. The company didn't approve."

Xia Sang shook his head.

He and Jin Fulai had only met a few times, yet the other man had not only treated him to meals before, but was now willing to help him for no apparent reason.

He truly hadn't expected Jin Fulai to help him like this.

Xia Sang couldn't help but let tears stream down her face.

Jin Fulai, sitting opposite her, was startled. This child's tears came so easily. Seeing Xia Sang's pitiful appearance, his heart softened involuntarily.

He wasn't stupid; he could tell Xia Sang was an honest child.

But all he could do was gently hug Xia Sang and pat her shoulder; there was nothing more he could do. His abilities were limited.

The bills poured in like water. One person had given him advice—a third female lead in a web drama he was involved in, named Bai Ling, almost thirty, pretty and charming, often seen with a fifty-year-old man.

She said she'd introduce him to a business opportunity, and asked Xia Sang, "How much money do you need?"

"One million."

Bai Ling was shocked. "How big of a fish would you have to fish to fill this hole?"

At the very party Bai Ling took him to, he ran into Master Liang again, assuming he was an actor at the event.

Unexpectedly, Bai Ling, seeing him staring intently at Master Liang, nudged his arm. "If you can handle this, one million won't be a problem."

"Who?"

"You're eyeing this one? You have good taste," Bai Ling said. "Do you know who that is? That's Liang Yiming, the boss of Morning Star, and Morning Star is just one company under his group, and..."

Listening to Bai Ling's explanation, Xia Sang realized that the person he'd first taken a liking to was actually quite powerful.

He had thought he had no chance, but unexpectedly, the other party accepted him.

As a contractual lover, Xia Sang didn't know what the road ahead held, but at this moment, he could only move forward, even if there was a huge pit in front of him, he could only jump in.

But instead of sinking to the bottom as he expected, someone tried to teach him how to climb back up.

That night, Xia Sang sat in his corner, holding the materials his teacher had given him, keeping Grandpa Liang company as he worked in the study. A whole sheet of test questions lay there; he'd already finished three by the time he returned. "Grandpa Liang, I'm so sleepy."

"That's good. Many people get overtaken while they're sleeping," Grandpa Liang said, browsing the latest investment plans on his computer. "It's only midnight; don't you think this is the perfect time to work hard?"

"My grandma says health is the most important thing," Xia Sang said, collapsing onto the sofa. "Grandpa Liang, going to bed early and waking up early is just as important."

"I wake up earlier than you," Grandpa Liang said.

"..." Unable to refute. So there really is a reason why some people become capitalists.

Xia Sang scrambled to her feet, excitedly saying, "Master Liang, I want to practice my acting!"

"...Then go to the next room. I'll be watching you on the monitor. Don't disturb my work."

"..." I mean, I want to rest.

"Once you get a score of 6 or higher, you can rest for a week," Master Liang said coldly.

Xia Sang had no choice but to pick up the fourth exam paper.

This is truly terrifying, Xia Sang thought.

...
The journey has been arduous, yet Xia Sang still felt happy, receiving love from many people. Perhaps that love seemed insignificant in the face of money, but in Xia Sang's heart, it nurtured her like a vast ocean.

Xia Sang watched the noisy Jin Fulai and Xiao Hong. Jin Ge came early every day because he was worried about him, and his bickering with Xiao Hong was just to help him relax.

He really was lucky, Xia Sang thought.

The next morning at six o'clock, most people were still asleep.

Suddenly, news broke online.

At the crack of dawn, Xia Sang was awakened by a knock on the door. He opened it, and before he could even ask anything, he heard Xiao Hong anxiously say—

"Brother Xia, Xiao Lin is dead!"
