Chapter 3 03 Party (Revised)

"Did Mr. Liang's secretary call you?" Jin asked suspiciously.

"Yes." Xia Sang reached for the snacks on the car seat, "But it wasn't Secretary Wang, it was Secretary Zhang. I even asked him to introduce me to a job!"

Jin Fulai glared at the snacks in Xia Sang's hand. "This suit is one I borrowed for you. Be careful not to get it dirty. And when you go inside, stay away from those people with red wine."

"Okay, okay."

Looking at Xia Sang's silly expression, Jin Fulai felt a pang of melancholy. He had been thinking about it all the way, still unsure what Mr. Liang meant. Did he want to take Xia Sang back? Then why didn't he renew the contract then? And why did he come looking for Xia Sang again two months later?

"Xia Sang..." Jin Fulai asked hesitantly.

"Hmm?"

"Grandpa Liang really doesn't have any special fetishes, right?"

Xia Sang looked at Brother Jin with suspicion, not understanding why he suddenly asked this question.

"It's just that kind of weird hobby."

"How weird?"

"It's like being tied up... ugh, am I asking you, or are you asking me!"

Brother Jin spat, and Xia Sang immediately pulled her curious head back.

"No."

"Really not?"

"Hmm... does liking kisses count? Does liking people clinging to him count?" Xia Sang thought for a moment and concluded, "Grandpa Liang likes clingy people."

Jin Fulai couldn't even imagine the image of Xia Sang clinging to Grandpa Liang's noble and aloof face.

"This scene is really a bit creepy..."

"Hahahaha."

"Wait, you're not kidding me, are you?"

"Hahahaha."

"You brat!"

Xia Sang laughed heartily at Jin Ge's constipated expression, because he genuinely remembered some happy things.

When they arrived at the event, Xia Sang stood to the side and followed the official queue to enter. He was in a relatively far back position, and he idly watched the celebrities walk by, playing a match-3 puzzle game, counting them one by one:

Ah, a top idol. Ah, the youngest Best Actor. Familiar face, but I don't remember the name. Familiar face, but I don't remember the name. Ah, a big star. Ah, his goddess. Don't know her. Don't know her...

Xia Sang lost count of how many he counted before it was finally his turn.

He roused himself and followed the host's instructions to enter. The front-row photographers snapped away according to the workflow. He briefly mentioned the procedures as the host explained, and some fans who managed to get into the front row kindly cheered for him.

And so, he entered smoothly.

This was the entire process for a relatively unknown actor.

Xia Sang actually did have some fans. His acting lessons over the past two years hadn't been in vain. His last role before breaking up with Liang Ye in a fantasy drama finally gave him some recognition.

He played a junior disciple in a sect. His role wasn't large, but fortunately, the character was always active alongside the male and female leads, and in the end, he sacrificed himself for the greater good. It was a story of a naive, mischievous child maturing and sacrificing himself for others.

Although the plot was somewhat formulaic, it was still endlessly entertaining and garnered tears from drama fans.

However, compared to the fan base of other top-tier celebrities, it was still far too small—like water in the ocean.

Upon entering, Xia Sang searched for his seat according to the invitation. He looked left and right; everywhere he looked was a sea of heads. In the dimly lit venue, it was impossible to see who was who. Xia Sang's seat was also towards the back, and a quick scan by the side cameras made it even harder to spot him. Even fans watching the live stream would probably need a magnifying glass to find him in the background.

Organizers usually try to group people from the same company at the same table in these back rows, but with so many people from the same company, and because they're relatively unknown, most don't know each other well, some only nodding acquaintances.

Everyone nodded to each other as a greeting.

Xia Sang, bored at her seat, texted Xiao Hong: "I'm so hungry, remember to prepare a midnight snack for me."

Xiao Hong was Xia Sang's assistant. His name sounded feminine, but he was actually a man, of average appearance and tall and thin. Xiao Hong liked to keep himself impeccably groomed and wear elaborate makeup, looking even more delicate than a girl.

Jin Fulai hadn't initially planned to hire Xiao Hong during the interview, finding him somewhat effeminate. But after Xia Sang learned that Xiao Hong had been rejected by several people, she pulled Jin Fulai aside and said, "Xiao Hong can be used as both a woman and a man; hiring one is like having two! Isn't that great!" After Xiao Hong demonstrated his comprehensive abilities, Jin Fulai hired him.

Xia Sang sent the message, and Xiao Hong replied instantly: 【Got it, got it, late-night hot and sour noodles / Thumbs up】

Then, she sent another message: 【By the way, Xia-ge, if you have time to sneak out later, I'll take some promotional photos for you at the hotel.】

Xia Sang: 【/dog frisbee bite OK.gif】

Xia Sang's seat was too far from the stage, and the host on stage was constantly reading from the script. The people next to her started gossiping, not very loudly, a few of them huddled together, whispering softly.

Xia Sang vaguely heard some of it and curiously turned her head slightly.

"Bai Tinglin climbed up."

"Looks like it."

"That's really something. That guy hasn't come out looking for someone for two years, has he?"

"Two years."

"He hasn't looked, or is someone so powerful that he's been following him for two years?"

"I haven't heard of him. Could it be...? Didn't he become famous two years ago?"

"No way, it could also be..."

This gossip is really fresh.

The reason no one can guess is because Xia Sang is young and inexperienced. After his first short drama aired after joining the company, he was heavily criticized and sent to school by Master Liang. He spends his days either filming or attending school.

He simply doesn't have time to meet these people, and of course, Xia Sang doesn't want to. Having lived a life of hardship, Xia Sang hasn't learned to flaunt what isn't his.

Xia Sang's mind wandered as he listened. He knew that most of the people who had worked for Liang Yiming before hadn't lasted long.

He thought for a long time. The reason he'd stayed with Master Liang for so long must be because he was both dim-witted and obedient! Two bowls of rice a day—easy to feed!

If Master Liang and his lover were in a palace drama, he'd definitely be the tea-serving eunuch beside the emperor. Though his role wasn't significant and his position low, he'd live a long time! Everyone would call him "Young Master Xia!"

Xia Sang couldn't help but laugh out loud at the thought.

Thinking this, Xia Sang shook his head happily. Young Master Xia had returned in two years, his wallet thicker, and he more educated.

The evening passed in Xia Sang's jumbled thoughts.

During the intermission, Xiao Hong texted Xia Sang: "Xia-ge, I snuck out!"

When Xia Sang saw Xiao Hong, she twirled around, praising him incessantly, "Wow~ Xia-ge looks so good today! Xia-ge never dresses up properly, it's such a waste of your good looks!"

"You look good because the clothes are expensive."

"The clothes are expensive, but our Xia-ge can afford them."

Xiao Hong pulled Xia Sang towards another passageway, "Never mind, I've already found a room, it's empty and nice, and has a huge floor-to-ceiling window, let's take some photos."

In the room, Xiao Hong, camera in hand, began giving instructions with practiced ease.

Besides regular appearances, Xiao Hong took and edited all of Xia Sang's other promotional photos.

Xia Sang thought that if Xiao Hong didn't want to be an assistant, she could easily be a photographer. Xiao Hong insisted he enjoyed being someone's assistant, so Xia Sang could only let him be, secretly asking Brother Jin to give Xiao Hong a raise.

"Brother Xia, you look quite aristocratic today," Xiao Hong said, twirling around a couple of times. "It's just that you're a bit young, not quite like a domineering CEO. Let's film a scene as an arrogant heir to a wealthy family."

Xia Sang was a little shy; he'd never played such a character before.

For the past two years, the gigs and events he'd taken on had mostly involved playing friendly, cheerful characters.

Xia Sang tried hard to recall what his teacher had taught him: a tense expression, a disdainful gaze, and he was going to act like a wealthy heir.

Xiao Hong frantically searched for the perfect angle with his camera, but even after taking the picture, he still didn't feel he looked handsome enough.

"Xia-ge, make your expression even more arrogant and domineering. You're very valuable, so act like you're all too good for me." Xiao Hong gestured for Xia Sang to stand back in her original position and instructed, "Let me think... like Master Liang, you should learn from him!"

Xiao Hong paused after speaking, and Xia Sang smiled and said, "It's okay."

Xia Sang thought of Liang Yiming's appearance—all in black, with an incredibly cool expression.

Master Liang is really handsome, Xia Sang thought to herself.

"Yes, yes, yes."

"Make your face even more grumpy."

"Wow, not bad."

"His eyes, his eyes, that's the essence!"

Xiao Hong snapped photos in quick succession. Xia Sang's usual style was more cheerful, so Xiao Hong thought the boy-next-door look would suit him better. But today, Xiao Hong thought even this outfit suited him perfectly, making him incredibly handsome. He predicted that once the photos were posted, some people would definitely go from calling him "son" to "boyfriend."

He couldn't help but sigh, wondering why Master Liang hadn't gotten Xia Ge some roles as a rich young master before. Maybe he'd have a chance to play the male lead in a web series. He always ended up with some terrible supporting roles. Although he gained some audience sympathy, his billing wasn't high enough.

Xia Sang and Xiao Hong were taking pictures enthusiastically when a laugh suddenly came from the doorway—

"Tch."

The two turned to see a man in a burgundy suit, quite handsome, with features somewhat resembling Mr. Liang.

"Hello, Mr. Liang," Xiao Hong greeted first. Xia Sang pursed her lips and then echoed her.

"This suit is from B brand, a design from two years ago. Didn't Lisa arrange it for you?"

Lisa was the costume director of Liang's Morning Star Entertainment. Previously, Xia Sang's outfits were arranged or purchased by Lisa and Brother Jin. Now that she had terminated her contract with Mr. Liang, she naturally no longer received this treatment.

"No, Mr. Liang," Xia Sang replied.

"Really?" Liang Yize forced a smile. "But I think these clothes suit you better than before."

Xia Sang remained silent, and he turned and left after speaking.

Xiao Hong, seeing this, moved to the doorway and peeked out. Seeing that Liang Yize was truly gone, she said, "Brother Xia, what was Mr. Liang doing here? What's wrong with his brain saying those things?"

He has no connection with Master Liang anymore, yet he still comes to provoke him. Xia Sang waved her hand. "He's got a problem with his brain. Alright, let's finish filming quickly, then we'll go back."

Back at her seat, Xia Sang overheard several people excitedly discussing that Master Liang had just come and circled around, seemingly looking for someone, but left shortly afterward, and no one knew who he was looking for.

Xia Sang glanced up a few times, then stopped listening to their discussion, figuring it had nothing to do with him.

He'd never heard of Liang Ye going back to an ex.

Xia Sang looked up at the grand stage, telling himself that one must look forward.

After the party, Xia Sang stood in a corner by the entrance, waiting for Xiao Hong to drive up. He watched the glamorous celebrities and big shots coming and going, their faces beaming with smiles beneath their flawless makeup, and felt that even after two years in this industry, it still felt somewhat unreal. The crowd there was so dense, like a juicy, sweet donut.

A moment later, Xia Sang saw an even bigger donut approaching in the distance. It was larger than any of the other donuts present; it was practically a behemoth.

Unable to resist her curiosity, Xia Sang tiptoed to peek, but after one glance, she hesitated again.

Master Liang!

Jin Ge had just gotten out of the car and was analyzing the situation with him, guessing that Master Liang had seen them at the hotel that day. The only unclear point was whether Master Liang was angry because he felt ignored since they were two nobodys, or if he suddenly had another idea to provoke them.

In any case, Jin Ge said that without figuring out the situation, it was best to avoid Master Liang for now, to avoid trouble.

Thinking of this, Xia Sang immediately moved further to the side, standing behind a pillar for a while.

Xia Sang wanted to see if Master Liang had left, so she glanced over.

Seeing Mr. Liang standing at the door with his entourage, a tall man stood beside him—it was the same boy from last time!

The boy was dressed flamboyantly, his dark purple suit shimmering, which accentuated his fair complexion. Unfortunately, his overly arrogant expression ruined the overall effect.

"Thank you for coming, Mr. Liang," the party organizer said, extending his hand to shake Liang Yiming's. "I hope our collaboration will go smoothly."

As he spoke, he glanced down at the young man beside Liang Yiming and, wanting to curry favor, suggested, "Mr. Bai, if you have time, I have a few suitable idol dramas you could audition for."

Bai Tinglin's eyes lit up at this, and he couldn't help but reach out and shake Liang Yiming's hand.

Liang Yiming raised his arm slightly, his gaze unchanged, and remained silent.

Bai Tinglin continued to pout, trying to act coquettishly, "Master Liang, I want to act~ I want to act~"

The others smiled teasingly, about to make a joke.

Liang Yiming spoke up, "That's all for today. Everyone, you can leave now."

Completely ignoring Bai Tinglin.

The atmosphere suddenly became awkward, and then everyone turned away with awkward laughter, as if nothing had happened, exchanging greetings and dispersing.

Only Bai Tinglin remained, his face pale.
