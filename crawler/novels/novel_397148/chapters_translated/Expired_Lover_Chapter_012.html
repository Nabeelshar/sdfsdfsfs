Chapter 31 12 Tricks

Nighttime, in Grandpa Liang's villa, the two were locked in a passionate embrace on the large bed.

Afterwards, Grandpa Liang leaned against the headboard. His hand, gloved in black leather, reached for a pack of cigarettes from the bedside table. Just as he was about to light one, Xia Sang, forcing herself to stay awake, grasped Grandpa Liang's hand. "Grandpa Liang, it's too late, smoke less."

Liang Yiming looked up. "Mm," he said, lighting a cigarette.

Xia Sang continued, "Grandpa Liang, I'm going to participate in a variety show tomorrow. I'll be back in a few days."

Actually, the filming location was in the city, but the variety show was a live broadcast, so she had to stay at the filming location with the children and couldn't come back.

"Mm, rest," Grandpa Liang said, stubbing out half a cigarette and pulling Xia Sang closer.

The next day, the variety show arranged for the five celebrities to depart from five different locations, eventually gathering together at the end.

Xia Sang departed from the Morning Star Company building. When he arrived at the building entrance, a live broadcast vehicle was parked downstairs. He finished his makeup, took his luggage, and went to Jin Ge's place.

Jin Ge was already discussing the itinerary and arrangements with other staff members.

"Good morning, Brother Jin."

"Xia Sang, come over and record your short interview first." Brother Jin pulled Xia Sang over. "After that, we'll start the live stream. First, you'll pick up a guest. The guest and their transportation will be decided by a raffle at the beginning."

"After picking up the guest, you'll go to the cabin to record. Xiao Hong will follow the camera car on the way. I'll be at the company, but the live stream rules state we can't appear on camera. If you need anything, call me privately."

"Okay." Xia Sang listened to Brother Jin's rambling. Brother Jin had already told him a lot of this before the broadcast, but he couldn't help but repeat it again today.

"It's our first time on a variety show, let's just play it safe."

"Brother Jin, don't be so nervous," Xia Sang comforted him. "Your nervousness is making me nervous too, haha."

"You rascal," Jin Fulai patted Xia Sang on the shoulder.

In the distance, the crew started shouting, "Ready to film! Everyone to your positions!"

The dark camera adjusted its position, aimed at Xia Sang's face, and slowly moved back. A red flash went off, and the live stream began—

At the same time, four other live stream cameras started rolling:

[Xiao Lin starts streaming—]

[Huo Ran starts streaming—]

[Le Mingzhi starts streaming—]

[Cong Hongfei starts streaming—]

Views started coming in gradually. Xia Sang had the lowest viewership among the five in this variety show. Only a few minutes into filming did a few scattered words of support appear in the comments.

1st Floor: Xia Xia! Congratulations Xia Xia on your new variety show!

2nd Floor: Soda will always be with Xia Xia!

3rd Floor: It's the company building! Xiaxia is full of energy today!

The host went through the flow, "Welcome everyone, dear intern dads! Our first segment involves our celebrity guests drawing lots to choose their paired little guests and transportation!"

Two large boxes appeared on camera, one with a cartoon image of a doll on it, and the other with a question mark indicating transportation.

"Come on, let's have Teacher Xia draw! First, she'll choose a little guest!"

Xia Sang reached into the first box, took out a slip of paper, and unfolded it. A small star was drawn on it.

"She's chosen our star design!" The host picked up a clue card. "What address does the star represent—'Shining Welfare Home' in the suburbs."

The host gave the star card to Xia Sang. "That place is a bit far from Teacher Xia's company, but that's okay!" "We have ten types of transportation, including nice cars and motorcycles. We won't reveal the cheaper ones yet. Hopefully, Teacher Xia will draw something good; even a long journey won't be a problem!"

Xiao Hong watched nervously as Xia Sang reached into the second box, slowly took it out—and flipped it over—it showed a picture of a bicycle.

Xia Sang flipped the card over; it also showed a picture of a bicycle.

The host looked down and said regretfully, "It seems Teacher Xia's luck isn't so great; she drew a bicycle."

Comments:

1st Floor: No way, riding a bicycle to the suburbs? It'll take at least two hours.

2nd Floor: Hell's the start...

3rd Floor: That's how it is on variety shows. Blame your bad luck.

4th Floor: LOL. Getting a bicycle is nothing. Huo Ran got a skateboard! Hahaha, what's the difference between that and walking?

For viewers with fast internet, switch between multiple video windows and have some fun. Let's see who's the unluckiest. If we're talking about location, Xia Sang is the unluckiest, getting the furthest place. The second unluckiest was Huo Ran. Le Mingzhi drew a car, Xiao Lin drew an electric car, Cong Hongfei and Xia Sang both drew bicycles, and Huo Ran drew a skateboard.

Because Le Mingzhi and Huo Ran were a team, the production team had them start from the same location. When Le Mingzhi held the car card and saw that Huo Ran had drawn a skateboard, he burst out laughing, "Hahahaha, Huo Ran, you have to believe that sometimes your luck is really bad, hahahaha!" "

Huo Ran looked at Le Mingzhi speechlessly, while the host and netizens filled the screen with laughter.

Huo Ran nonchalantly accepted a black skateboard. Actually, he wasn't too unlucky; the place he drew wasn't far from the variety show's house, and he could walk there with the child in his arms.

Comments:

1st Floor: I'm dying of laughter, these two are like night and day.

2nd Floor: Lele's drawn place is actually the closest." "We arrived before even starting the car, haha!"

3rd Floor: "Brother Hongfei, your luck was so-so, but at least the place isn't that far."

4th Floor: "But why are the third and fourth places so far apart?"

Xia Sang, holding the bicycle provided by the production team, searched on his phone. The navigation predicted a 2-hour and 12-minute ride.

He looked around, then started riding without saying a word.

At first it was fine, but gradually his stamina dropped. Xia Sang was covered in sweat and had to stop by the roadside to rest, panting and laughing, "This show isn't an internship, Dad, it's a transformation, Dad!" "

The live stream showed Xia Sang looking disheveled; some were happy, some were upset.

1st Floor: So funny, hahaha.

2nd Floor: I feel sorry for Xia Xia. Arranging such a tool from so far away, the production team is so unreliable.

3rd Floor: Bad luck, just lucky draws.

4th Floor: Oh my god, drenched in sweat, it really is a transformation program.

5th Floor: That's a bit much. The guest isn't a professional athlete. A four-hour round trip by bicycle, the planning is flawless, right?

...

Upon arriving at the location, Xia Sang looked up at the courtyard. An old outer wall, a large green tree extending from the courtyard, looked warm in the sunlight. An elderly woman stood at the gate, holding..." Leading a five- or six-year-old boy, the boy wore a striped T-shirt and denim overalls. He had a fair complexion, was a little short, but extremely cute.

He timidly hid behind the caretaker, his big eyes fixed on Xia Sang.

Xia Sang put down his bicycle, swaying slightly, his legs feeling weak. He was exhausted from riding for two hours.

Xia Sang still touched his face, tugged at his clothes, trying to look a little better, but his morning makeup and hairstyle were all ruined, and he was drenched in sweat. Luckily, his good looks saved the day; otherwise, no one would recognize him as a celebrity.

Xia Sang slowly walked to the little boy and squatted down.

"This child is quite quiet," the caretaker said, handing Xia Sang the boy's hand. "Xingxing, Uncle has come to pick you up." "

Xia Sang gently held the little boy's hand, finding it soft and adorable. "What's his name?"

"His full name is Chen Xing, his nickname is Xingxing."

"That's a lovely name." The little boy pursed his lips, giving a shy smile.

After resting for a while and having lunch at the orphanage, Xia Sang was about to take Xingxing back by bike.

Before getting on the bike, Xia Sang heard his phone ring. He took it out and saw a message from Xiao Hong: [Brother Xia, I secretly checked the prop box, and all the cards are the same.]

Xia Sang didn't say anything. This time, he rode very, very slowly, stopping frequently. He was truly exhausted, especially with a little boy in tow.

Many people online saw the two-hour bike ride to the orphanage, and they still had to ride... "It's not like it's an extreme sports variety show. Many people think there's something wrong with it. Is it really necessary for a parent-child program?" The other four guests had already arrived; only Xia Sang was still on his way.

As more and more people questioned the show online, the production team immediately stopped Xia Sang, asked him to get in the car, and offered to drive him home.

In the air-conditioned car, Xia Sang was sweating and felt cold. He quickly asked Xingxing if he was cold. Xingxing shook his head. He had been wearing a small yellow hat the whole way, enjoying the cool breeze in the back seat.

"Do you have a towel?" "Xia Sang asked, and the program assistant handed her a towel. Xia Sang wiped the beads of sweat from Xingxing's forehead and then wiped her own.

With the program crew's car, Xia Sang and the others returned quickly.

But the further they went, the more familiar the surroundings became to Xia Sang, until finally they found themselves in the villa area halfway up Liang Ye's mountain.

Xia Sang nervously gripped her hands, the cold touch of her fingertips spreading throughout her body.

Liang Yize was playing..." What a scheme!

Why did he choose this place?

They soon arrived at the program crew's villa. Xia Sang could only get out of the car with his luggage and Xingxing by the hand.

As soon as he reached the door, he heard a loudspeaker at the entrance of the cabin announce, "Congratulations to our last guest for arriving at the 'Internship House.' All guests, please gather in the living room for the first activity. The last person to arrive will receive a small punishment."

As expected of Liang Yize, a master of one disgusting scheme after another.

Xia Sang couldn't help but feel annoyed.
