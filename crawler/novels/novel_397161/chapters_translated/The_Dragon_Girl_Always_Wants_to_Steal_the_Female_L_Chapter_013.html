Chapter 13

Pei Ning walked step by step towards Qin Chen, and Nie Suisui's joy was visibly obvious.

Pei Ning was a pushover, easy to manipulate. As soon as she got close to Qin Chen, he would treat her like a captive, and then they could reap the benefits, taking their food and—

The smile on Nie Suisui's face was still blooming when it suddenly froze at the corner of her mouth.

Pei Ning swiftly grabbed Qin Chen's arm. Everyone's vision blurred, and before they could react, Qin Chen was twisted like a pretzel by Pei Ning, his arm wrapped behind his back. Pei Ning dragged him back several steps, raising her chin to stare intently at Nie Suisui.

"What is your mission?! Qin Chen was bitten by a zombie, and you're begging for medicine?! Did you just try to steal our gold leaves and food, leaving us to fend for ourselves?!"

A barrage of questions, delivered in a seemingly innocent yet fierce tone, initially startled Qiao Song.

Nie Suisui blushed and stammered, "We didn't...we didn't want your gold leaves! We just wanted some food! We're starving!"

"Lying!"

Pei Ning looked at her confidently, "You blinked more frequently than usual, and your stuttering and nervousness indicate a guilty conscience. Your first thought was our gold leaves, which means your goal was to steal them. You wouldn't be this anxious if it were a normal robbery. The only possibility is—"

She snorted, "One of you is injured..." "But we don't have enough gold leaf for the dressing. You're here to buy time to get the medicine and save people!"

Comments: "Holy crap, holy crap, holy crap, has my Goose's IQ suddenly reached new heights?"

Comments: "Hahahaha, I'm dying of laughter! Everyone thought she was a naive and innocent girl, but when they opened her head, she was a monster!"

Comments: "Hahaha, Qiao Song thought, holy crap, is my wife this awesome?"

Nie Suisui panicked. She hadn't expected Pei Ning to realize something was wrong so quickly. Qin Chen was being held hostage; their team was going to lose. Nie Suisui was almost in tears.

Qin Chen tried to struggle, but Pei Ning had strength from who-knows-where, holding his arm down like iron clamps, making him unable to move.

“We can give you gold leaves and food.”

Pei Ning looked at Nie Suisui with a haughty expression. “We’ll exchange tasks!”

Anyway, the pancake shop is gone now, and Xiaodouzi can’t go home, so this task can’t continue.

In comparison, they need to choose a task that they can complete.

Qing Tuan: "...You're quite clever, knowing to go with Qiao Song to increase your chances of one-on-one contact."

Pei Ning: "???"

Pei Ning: "No, I'm just going to earn gold leaves."

Qing Tuan: "???"

Nie Suisui looked at Qin Chen with pleading eyes. Qin Chen resignedly closed his eyes and sighed, "Just agree to them. If I don't get gold leaves, I'm doomed. I won't be able to complete any missions."

Nie Suisui looked at Pei Ning with some frustration, "Our mission is at Guanghua Tower, we just need to get..." "Once we reach the Buddha's relics in Guanghua Tower, the zombies in the city will disappear, the people will be saved, and we will receive a reward..."

Comments: "Well done!!!"

Comments: "I've noticed Pei Ning is quite clever. Knowing the mission was stuck and couldn't be completed, she chose to exchange missions. In this situation, there really isn't a better way than exchanging missions."

Comments: "Stop praising her, stop praising her. If we keep praising her, some fans will get angry again. Let's keep a low profile!"

This live stream has already attracted over 60 million viewers.

Pei Ning's Weibo follower count is skyrocketing. Qiao Song's fans, who were initially quite critical, have fallen silent after seeing Qiao Song putting shoes on Pei Ning.

What can you do if she won't shut up?

Their ancestor insisted on kneeling down to put shoes on her, and she did it willingly!

It wasn't Pei Ning holding a knife to her throat and forcing her to do it!

At least, this person isn't like Nie Suisui, constantly whining and complaining about being a zombie.

Nie Suisui has already been the subject of countless funny videos edited by Qin Chen's fans.

And the other couple is even worse; they've only been playing for a short time, and they're completely wiped out.

At least—

Qiao Song's fans comforted themselves.

At least Pei Ning is adorably silly.

At least, this is what Qiao Song likes.

When Pei Ning and Qiao Song arrived at Guanghua Tower, it was quiet all around. It was already dark. A lamp hung in front of the tower's entrance, and the door opened with a gentle push.

After Pei Ning and Qiao Song stepped inside, the door slammed shut, and the sound of a lock clicking shut echoed from outside. The inside was pitch black.

(Camera recording at night.)

Pei Ning slowly stepped back, her feet getting stuck at the threshold, and her body slammed against the door with a dull thud. Qiao Song grabbed her, and Pei Ning looked bewildered. "Qiao Song, am I blind?"

Qiao Song slowly felt her arm, then grabbed her hand, his voice still calm. "No."

"It's a bit dark, maybe it's a trap set by the director. Don't move."

Qiao Song paused. "And don't be afraid."

Pei Ning: "Are you kidding me? How could I be afraid! I'm a carp spirit who's been hopping around outside the Dragon Gate for two thousand years! I've survived those dark days! I! Aren't! Afraid!" Qing Tuan: "No, you're scared."

Qing Tuan: "Last time, your progress was so fast because you hugged Qiao Song. Why don't you try hugging her again this time?"

Pei Ning: "?"

Pei Ning: "Okay!"

Pei Ning immediately snuggled into Qiao Song's arms, hugging her waist, and sobbed on her shoulder in the darkness, "It's so dark... Waaah... I'm so scared..."

Qiao Song didn't push her away, but helplessly held her waist, slowly patting her back, "...I saw you were pretty good at dealing with Qin Chen."

Back then, her actions were so fierce, everyone who saw it thought she was a martial arts master.

Pei Ning stiffened, lifting her chin to look at her. Unable to see Qiao Song's face, she could only whimper pitifully, "I...I didn't."

Her breath was shallow, lightly brushing against her chin like a feather, tickling slightly.

Qiao Song unconsciously swallowed.

Pei Ning hugged her tightly, nuzzling against her. "I'm so scared, Qiao Song, you have to hold me tonight."

Qiao Song looked around, wanting to pull her away, but felt it would be too cruel. After a long pause, she managed to utter two words, "...Too hot."

Pei Ning fell silent.

Qingtuan: "Master, night vision has been activated for you. Please use it carefully to avoid being discovered."

Pei Ning: "..."

She looked up at Qiao Song.

Qiao Song's face was tense, whether from nervousness or fear. Her beautiful phoenix eyes darted around, as if observing the situation.

However, she couldn't see in the dark, so there was a hint of confusion in her eyes. Clearly, she didn't know what was going on either.

Pei Ning caught sight of a camera slowly moving in the corner of the wall.

Pei Ning released Qiao Song, took her hand, and slowly intertwined her fingers with Qiao Song's, their hands locked. She encouraged Qiao Song, "Qiao Song, let's find the relic together. Maybe when we find it, it won't be so dark here anymore."

The director certainly wouldn't let them climb the stairs in such a dark place.

Pei Ning, holding Qiao Song's hand, moved slowly. The hall's layout was very simple: cabinets lined the walls, a Buddha statue stood against the backdrop, and stairs led up and down on either side. The relic's location was still unknown. Pei Ning, moving slowly, analyzed the situation for Qiao Song, "Let's look slowly; maybe we'll find it."

Qiao Song didn't speak. After a few seconds, she asked, "Can you see it?"

Pei Ning almost fell, quickly grabbing Qiao Song's hand. She quickly denied it, "I can't see it, but I can't cause Qiao Song any trouble!"

Qiao Song remained silent again.

Just then, a series of thumping sounds came from outside the door. Pei Ning saw zombie figures bouncing around outside the window and, terrified, quickly pulled Qiao Song down to crouch beneath the wooden table under the Buddha statue.

As soon as they crawled inside, the door to Guanghua Tower opened, and the zombies, backlit by the light, hopped in from outside.

There were countless of them.

Pei Ning, frightened, burrowed into Qiao Song's arms.

Qiao Song grabbed her shoulders to prevent her from moving around and making any more noise.

The two of them peered through the gaps under the red cloth from under the table.

The zombies hopped around aimlessly, as if searching for someone.

If the zombies found them, they were doomed.

Pei Ning's body was tense and stiff. Moonlight and lamplight streamed into the hall from the doorway. She and Qiao Song huddled together, neither daring to move.

The sound of zombie footsteps grew closer, many hopping around them. One zombie even tripped and fell, losing a tooth in the process.

The zombie nonchalantly got up, looked around, reattached its tooth, and continued hopping as if nothing had happened.

Qiao Song's breathing became shallow with tension.

Pei Ning huddled in her arms, wanting to lift the red cloth slightly to peek outside, but Qiao Song held her down, preventing her from moving.

The zombies outside hopped and skipped around for a long time before slowly moving away.

The world returned to silence.

So quiet you could hear a pin drop.

Pei Ning thought it was over.

Suddenly, a pair of boots appeared under the red cloth in front of them.

A zombie had stopped there.

Qiao Song didn't dare move a finger. Although they had peach wood swords, they were in their bundle, and they didn't know if there were any other zombies in the room.

Both women held their breath, fearing the zombie would lift the red cloth and see them.

Pei Ning's eyes were sore from staring so intently. Only when the owner of the boots in front of her started hopping to the side did she finally breathe a sigh of relief. Before she could even catch her breath, Qiao Song covered her mouth.

The zombie, who had been about to leave, stopped abruptly upon hearing the noise.

With Qiao Song covering her mouth and nose, Pei Ning dared not breathe, her face turning almost red.

The zombie showed no sign of leaving.

It seemed to be stopping there.

Pei Ning dared not breathe; having held her breath for so long, her brain was starting to feel oxygen-deprived.

Pei Ning: "I just came to play a game, why am I taking it so seriously! Losing is fine, okay?!"

Pei Ning: "I can't hold it in anymore! Am I the first dragon to suffocate?!"

Pei Ning: "Help me!!!"

Perhaps hearing her inner cry, just as Pei Ning felt she was about to suffocate, the hand covering her loosened. The zombie hadn't left, but the next second, cold fingers pinched the back of her neck, and she saw Qiao Song's stunningly beautiful face approach.

His red lips, so alluring, inexplicably sealed hers.

Pei Ning: "???"

Pei Ning: "Hey, softie!"

She blankly accepted Qiao Song's breath, her breathing finally becoming easier. By the time Qiao Song's lips left, the zombie was gone. The door wasn't closed. Qiao Song released her, and Pei Ning snuggled closer to her.

Qiao Song instinctively pressed down on her waist.

Pei Ning smiled foolishly at her, "Qiao Song, were you kissing me just now?"

Pei Ning: "Qiao Song's lips are so sweet and soft, and you were even trying to pry my lips open—"

"Shut up."

Qiao Song wished she could disappear into a crack in the ground, "That was CPR, don't think like that."

"Oh—"

Pei Ning pouted; she wasn't thinking anything!
