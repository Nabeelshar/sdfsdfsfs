Chapter 8

Pei Ning washed up and went to Longfenglou.

This was one of the most famous restaurants in Beijing, said to have existed since the Qing Dynasty. The chefs were descendants of imperial chefs; whether the food was good or not was another matter, but many celebrities enjoyed dining there.

Longfenglou occupied a large area, a square, multi-story building with a large pool in the center. Four vermilion pillars stood majestically on either side, each topped with a dragon and phoenix wood carving. The craftsmanship of Qing Dynasty carpenters was evident; the dragons, baring their teeth, coiled from the pillars, their heads menacing, their fangs lifelike, as if breathing into the pool.

The dragon's body was carved and then pieced together. Pei Ning stood by the pool, staring at the wooden dragon for a long time, then scratched her head.

Qing Tuan: "Why can't you walk anymore?"

Pei Ning: "...I just didn't expect that we'd be seen as so ugly by humans."

Even if she were a little bald dragon, her body would still be clean and white, and her face...

wasn't that ugly?

She touched her nose, glanced at the phoenix with outstretched wings, and muttered, "Why is the phoenix so much prettier than the dragon..."

The feathers were even carved so lifelike, almost like real ones.

Phoenixes are as rare as dragons, especially these days with severe air pollution and advanced human exploration technology. Their immortal islands have been carefully concealed to remain undiscovered.

Pei Ning looked around for a while before finally remembering her purpose for coming here.

...She was here to see Qiao Song.

Qiao Song and the director were meeting in a private room on the second floor. She listened to their conversation as she walked upstairs.

She couldn't hear Qiao Song's voice, only her goofy cousin nagging incessantly, "Getting this role is easy, but Qiao Song, you don't have much experience. Wanting the lead role is a bit of a pipe dream, isn't it?"

Pei Ning couldn't imagine what the gentle and kind Qiao Song's expression would be like.

She heard that there seemed to be quite a few people inside. A woman's voice, pouting, came from beside her cousin, Zhen Aiqian, "Ah Qian, you're so annoying! Didn't you say you were going to reserve the lead role for me? Qiao Song's acting is pretty good too, isn't it perfect for me to play a supporting role?"

Pei Ning, having reached the corner of the stairs, clenched her fists inexplicably upon hearing this.

Then Zhen Aiqian chuckled, "Of course! She offended my sister, Pei Ning. It's already a miracle she got the role; what good role could she possibly get? Director Zhang, we're not here to snatch her away halfway through. Even without my little darling, you wouldn't have chosen her, would you?"

"This…"

The director, whose voice sounded noticeably older, hesitated.

Pei Ning's anger deepened, inwardly cursing—

Fool! All the goodwill she'd painstakingly built up with Qiao Song these past few days...

Was it all ruined by this bastard!!!

Pei Ning awkwardly walked in her high heels. A waiter tried to approach her, but she waved him away.

The palace lanterns on the second floor were lit, casting a warm red glow on the corridor. Her curly hair was loose, and she wore a basic off-the-shoulder white dress, a string of exquisite pearls around her neck. Hearing the silence inside, she stopped at the doorway.

“Hey, Qiao Song, don’t be discouraged. If you’re willing to spend two days with me, I might be happy to give you a supporting role. Anyway, with your price tag—”

“Bang!”

A door was kicked open by Pei Ning. The two large doors, patched with red paint, wobbled precariously. Pei Ning stood outside the threshold, looking up at the people inside.

She looked at Qiao Song first.

Today, Qiao Song was wearing a simple black T-shirt and jeans, and she wasn’t even wearing makeup—

It’s common knowledge that when directors are scouting actors, actors can’t wear heavy makeup; some even require them to go makeup-free.

Her heart tightened.

Pei Ning could tell that Qiao Song had come to this gathering with genuine sincerity.

Pei Ning suppressed her anger, and Qiao Song naturally noticed her as well.

But at this moment, in this room, the way Qiao Song looked at her was like looking at a stranger.

No, even more distant and indifferent than a stranger.

Perhaps he felt that she and Zhen Aiqian were in cahoots, and that he had only invited her here to treat her like a fat fish, to be lured in and humiliated.

Qiao Song didn't even have his manager with him, only a green assistant, clearly a novice, who was terrified in this situation, his face pale and his legs trembling.

Zhen Aiqian was the first to react, shoving aside the heavily made-up woman beside him and standing up to greet her, "It's my cousin! Ningning, are you here for drinks too?"

Pei Ning clenched her fists, ignoring him, and walked straight to the woman.

Her face was fierce, and the woman seemed a little intimidated, shrinking back in fear, "Pei... Miss Pei, what are you doing?"

Pei Ning stood there, without a trace of a smile, completely unlike her usual innocent and docile image, as if she had reverted to her former arrogant and domineering self.

Pei Ning raised his chin, clenching his fist, looking somewhat fierce but undeniably intimidating. "Apologize!"

The woman clearly hadn't expected Pei Ning to demand an apology. Before she could even speak, Zhen Aiqian started babbling, "Ningning, why are you being so mean to our Jiajia? What's there to apologize for? Who are you apologizing to? What did she do to you? Brother, I'll give you—"

Pei Ning splashed a glass of wine on Zhen Aiqian's face.

Everyone in the room was startled by the splash; even the chubby director's flabby muscles trembled slightly.

Zhen Aiqian's mouth trembled; he wanted to be angry but dared not.

Pei Ning was the only granddaughter of the Pei family, and they cherished her like the apple of their eye.

He looked dejected, wiping his face like a grandson apologizing, his tone tinged with doubt: "Ningning...?"

"Qiao Song is my friend."

Pei Ning interrupted him, her attitude indicating she wasn't going to listen to his explanation, "From now on, you're not allowed to make things difficult for her anymore."

Zhen Aiqian: "..."

Zhen Aiqian: "???"

Wait, what's wrong with this young lady?

Just a week ago, she clearly said she'd make sure Qiao Song couldn't make it in the entertainment industry!

She was gritting her teeth and stomping her feet, declaring she never wanted to see any of Qiao Song's film or television work again!

How did she suddenly start protecting him?

Zhen Aiqian's eyes were brimming with tears, his face clearly asking "Why?" Pei Ning suddenly felt a pang of guilt.

Qing Tuan: "What's there to feel guilty about? You weren't the one who ordered him to do bad things, it was the original owner! Go, Master! Charge!"

Pei Ning straightened up abruptly, staring intently at Zhen Aiqian. "Didn't you understand what I said?"

Zhen Aiqian shook his head, then slowly nodded. He pointed aggrievedly at Qiao Song, then at himself, "Didn't you say before—"

"Didn't I say before that Qiao Song is a good actress and shouldn't be overlooked? You were going to introduce her to more good opportunities!?"

Pei Ning's voice rose slightly, his back to Qiao Song, not daring to look at Qiao Song's expression.

…She felt guilty.

Zhen Aiqian's lips moved, hesitant to speak, his expression towards Pei Ning extremely strange.

Pei Ning raised an eyebrow at him, "What you just said was really too much! Apologize to Qiao Song!"

Afraid that this wasn't enough, Pei Ning coughed lightly, gritted his teeth, and said in a voice only the two of them could hear, "Do you want to be fired from the company or have your shares taken back?"

Zhen Aiqian's eyes instantly filled with terror.

He blurted out, "Qiao Song, I'm sorry!"

He glanced at Pei Ning, moved in front of Qiao Song, and said respectfully, "Qiao Song, I'm really sorry…"

Pei Ning stood silently behind Qiao Song.

Qiao Song remained silent throughout, merely staring indifferently at Zhen Aiqian. Zhen Aiqian, weeping uncontrollably, slapped herself in apology, "I was so outspoken, blind, and incapable of distinguishing right from wrong, I went too far..."

Her arrogance vanished.

The atmosphere around Qiao Song, however, became much more tense.

Qiao Song stood up, a smile on her face, but she had already grabbed her bag. She said to the director, "Director Zhang, I feel this film isn't really suitable for me. Perhaps we can work together again sometime. Thank you for gracing us with this meal today."

She bowed slightly, and the portly director also struggled to his feet, clasping his hands together in a gesture of apology and gratitude.

Zhen Aiqian was still apologizing, but Qiao Song didn't even look at him. She simply called her assistant, turned, and left.

She completely ignored Pei Ning, who was standing behind her.

Pei Ning panicked. "I asked him to apologize, so why is Qiao Song even angrier?! This isn't right!!!"

Qing Tuan: "...So hurry up and chase after her!"

Pei Ning glanced at the others in the room, gritted her teeth, and quickly went to catch up with Qiao Song.

Qiao Song had driven there in a white Porsche Mykai, her own car that she usually shared with her assistant, so it wasn't used very often.

Just as she opened the car door, she saw Pei Ning chasing after her.

For some reason, Pei Ning wasn't with her assistant today, nor was she wearing a mask or hat. She rushed out in her high heels, seemingly on the verge of a whirlwind. Turning around, she saw Qiao Song standing by the car and hurriedly chased after him.

Qiao Song climbed inside to close the car door.

"Qiao Song!"

Pei Ning pressed down on the car door to prevent it from closing, explaining breathlessly, "I didn't know Zhen Aiqian would come and cause trouble! I didn't know he would humiliate you! I—"

Qiao Song turned to look at her, meeting her flushed face from panting.

Qiao Song's phoenix eyes crinkled with laughter, her beauty mark glistening. "Then how did you know I met the director today?"

"I..."

Pei Ning had no answer; she couldn't very well say that Qing Tuan had told her.

She gripped the car door, still searching for words. Qiao Song whispered, "Savior, hero, high and mighty young lady, what's the point of you coming here?"

She met Pei Ning's gaze, her tone slightly sarcastic, "Is it to watch them mock me, humiliate me, trample my self-esteem bit by bit, and then pretend to be a saint to save me?"

Pei Ning's eyes dimmed, as if all starlight had vanished in that instant. "I didn't, I didn't, I..."

"What is your purpose?"

Qiao Song looked at her questioningly, feeling a strange pain in her heart.

"Are you trying to get closer to me, build a good relationship, and then compete with me for my man, or—"

Qiao Song scoffed, a hint of self-mockery in her voice, "Then let me tell you, I have absolutely no interest in Lu Jinxiao. I won't like him. He's yours, are you relieved?"

Seeing Pei Ning's fingers slowly loosen from the car door, she turned her gaze back, staring coldly ahead, "Just be your pampered young lady. There's no need to concern yourself with the lives of us little actors. If you came here today to watch a show, then you've succeeded."

She gripped the steering wheel tightly. "At least your acting today was passable."

Qiao Song maintained her last shred of pride, but her hands on the steering wheel trembled. She glanced sideways at Pei Ning, seeing Pei Ning take a step back, her face streaked with tears.

Qiao Song didn't know why, but even breathing hurt.

She guessed right.

She was right.

This woman's cuteness and enthusiasm were all an act, all an act for Lu Jinxiao.

Without Lu Jinxiao, she could never get close to her.

She liked Lu Jinxiao, how could she—

Qiao Song's smile was sarcastic and desperate; how could she possibly harbor such fantasies?

…
Qing Tuan: "Master, your progress bar with Qiao Song has even lost its green tinge. If there's no progress soon, your mission will fail!"

Pei Ning lazily rolled over on her large bed, her eyes swollen like walnuts, almost unable to open.

"But she hates me so much, how am I supposed to get started?!"

She fumed. "And she said she doesn't like Lu Jinxiao! If she doesn't like Lu Jinxiao, then the mission is accomplished, right?! Why am I still failing?! This is so hard, waaaaah..."

Qingtuan: "We're recording 'The First Time I Met You' again tomorrow. As far as I know, Lu Jinxiao isn't a guest tomorrow, so you and Qiao Song will definitely be a couple. Seize this opportunity to make her believe in you and stop being wary of you!"
