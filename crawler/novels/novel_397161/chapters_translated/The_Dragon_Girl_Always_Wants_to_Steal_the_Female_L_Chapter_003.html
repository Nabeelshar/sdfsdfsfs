Chapter 3

Josong's gaze was complex. She lowered her eyes, examining Pei Ning's wound, her tone somewhat harsh: "Who I'm with, who I like, is none of your business! Why are you interfering?"

Pei Ning hugged her arms, looking aggrieved. "...You're mean to me."

Josong: "..."

Pei Ning sobbed, "I just saved you, I got hurt for you, and you're mean to me? Josong, how could you do this?"

She blew on her injured arm. "My arm hurts, my back hurts, and my butt hurts too."

Qiao Song looked up at her, seeing her innocent expression, she bit her lip, her exquisitely beautiful phoenix eyes slightly narrowing. "I'll take you to the hospital."

"I don't want to."

Pei Ning grabbed her hand, scratching the back of it with her fingers, her face sincere. "Qiao Song, if you truly want to thank me, grant me one request."

Qiao Song straightened up, feeling a little awkward, but still didn't pull her hand away. "Promise you what?"

This woman, could she be trying to make her stay far away from Lu Jinxiao?

Pei Ning gripped her index finger. "I want you to promise me that you'll stay far away from Lu Jinxiao from now on."

Just as she thought.

Qiao Song sneered inwardly. In the end, it all came down to Lu Jinxiao. This woman—

Couldn't she come up with something different?

Qiao Song's expression darkened as she heard Pei Ning's righteous indignation, "You're beautiful, you earn money, and you're a good actress. That scumbag Lu Jinxiao doesn't deserve you at all!"

Qiao Song's fingers paused. She met Pei Ning's gaze. Pei Ning's almond-shaped eyes, round and dark, looked at her with sparkling eyes. "He's playing games, two-timing, wanting my family to provide him with money and connections, and also wanting your beauty and talent. There's no such thing as a free lunch!"

Her cheeks puffed out in anger. "Anyway, you can't let him fool you anymore! You can't play with that scumbag anymore! He'll hurt you!"

Qiao Song subconsciously felt that Pei Ning was different from before.

In the past, Pei Ning would try every means to sabotage her relationship with Lu Jinxiao whenever she saw them together.

In her previous life, even after she and Lu Jinxiao were together, Pei Ning would stick to Lu Jinxiao's side 24/7.

Anyone who didn't know better would think they were a couple.

Qiao Song met Pei Ning's gaze again.

Those eyes were clear and calm, as innocent as a child's.

Completely different from the arrogant and domineering Pei Ning of the past.

Qiao Song's heart pounded a little, but she still said coldly, "Why should I agree to you?"

Pei Ning deflated, releasing her hand. "I knew it. I've done so many things to hurt you before. No matter what I say, you won't believe me anymore."

Pei Ning's face fell. She looked up at the night sky, wiping away the faint tears from the corners of her eyes. "It's okay if you don't agree. From now on, I'll stay away from you. Qiao Song, you must really dislike and hate me, waaaaah..."

She turned her head away, her shoulders trembling. "So the perfect score you gave me was fake, waaaaah..."

Qiao Song: "..."

She didn't know that some women really are made of water.

Pei Ning buried her head in her knees, sobbing, "Then why do you still care about me? Just leave. It's none of your business if I get hurt. Let me die in pain, waaaaah..."

Qing Tuan lay on the grass, a blade of grass dangling from her mouth, watching Pei Ning's act.

Seeing Qiao Song's reluctant expression, and finally her closing her eyes as if in surrender, Qing Tuan jumped up, "Master, Master, she's been tricked! She's been tricked!"

Pei Ning covered her face with her arm, secretly glancing at the helpless Qiao Song, continuing to cry, but inwardly scoffing, "What do you mean 'tricked'? She was clearly moved by my sincerity!"

She pinched herself hard, tears welling up in her eyes, her eyes red.

Qiao Song's voice was muffled, "I promise you, don't cry."

Afraid Pei Ning would still be upset, she added, "We have filming tomorrow. Do you want your eyes to swell up like walnuts when you're on camera?"

Pei Ning's crying stopped abruptly.

She looked up, her nose slightly red, looking pitiful, "You really promised me?"

Qiao Song bit her lip and hummed in agreement. Before she could say anything more, Pei Ning reached out her little finger and hooked it with hers, giving her a sweet smile, "Qiao Song is so sweet! We're hooked up, you have to keep your word!"

Qiao Song: "..."

What an incredibly naive and innocent girl!

She didn't know Pei Ning's true purpose, but since Pei Ning wanted to play along, she'd play along to the end.

Qiao Song reached for a tissue to wipe her tears, but Pei Ning dodged back, grabbed the tissue, and hastily wiped her face before jumping up. "Qiao Song, I found out! Tomorrow morning we're choosing a partner for breakfast. I'll make you a special meal, you have to choose me!"

Qiao Song frowned slightly as she ran off.

Tomorrow, Pei Ning actually wants to be her partner?

...
At six in the morning, the program's task cards were distributed to the female guests.

Pei Ning naturally received one too.

Each of them had to prepare a unique breakfast for the male guests to choose from; the person they chose would be their partner for the day.

The kitchen was separate. There were four female guests in total. Pei Ning had never cooked before, but with Qing Tuan as her little encyclopedia, she followed the video tutorials and successfully cooked a pot of food—

Fried steamed bun slices.

The steamed bun slices, coated in egg wash, were fried until crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Pei Ning drew hearts on each slice with ketchup.

Pei Ning: "As long as Qiao Song is with me, he won't have time to interact with Lu Jinxiao. If he doesn't interact, he won't like him, and if he doesn't like him, he won't get hurt!"

Pei Ning: "Perfect!"

Qing Tuan: "I understand the logic, but why did you put a bandage on your arm, Master?"

The wound healed after returning to her room last night.

Pei Ning: "We have to let Qiao Song see it."

She arranged the steamed bun slices on a plate, paused, and said, "Every time my wound reappears, I remind her. I got injured because of her; she should at least listen to her savior, right?"

Even if she doesn't listen, Qiao Song still owes her a favor, right?

Even if Qiao Song doesn't want to repay that favor, her image in Qiao Song's eyes should at least change, right?

Pei Ning smugly thought, "Pretending isn't illegal."

Qing Tuan: "...So despicable, so shameless, but I like it!"

Breakfast was ready, and the female guests needed to take it out. When Pei Ning went out, she saw that Qiao Song had also prepared breakfast. Noticing Pei Ning's gaze, Qiao Song turned to look at her. Pei Ning gave her a sweet smile, and then saw the breakfast Qiao Song had prepared—

One fried sausage and two round fried eggs.

Pei Ning: "I knew it! Qiao Song loves me so much! The breakfast she made is a perfect 100! It was specially made for me!"

Qing Tuan: "No way, Master, maybe she was too lazy to make anything else."

Pei Ning: "How! Impossible!"

She secretly glanced at Qiao Song, seeing him standing ramrod straight, his slender figure beautifully outlined. She sweetly said, "Qiao Song is so amazing! He can even fry eggs so perfectly round, so wonderful!"

Qing Tuan: "...Isn't this the effect of frying in a mold pan?"

Pei Ning pretended not to hear, staring at Qiao Song with a dreamy expression. Soon, the male guests arrived.

Lu Jinxiao, the final guest, nearly popped his eyes out when he saw Pei Ning appear in the lobby.

Last night, Pei Ning had clearly promised him she wouldn't participate in the filming anymore!

Why was she still here?!

Realizing he was surrounded by cameras, Lu Jinxiao's astonishment vanished in an instant, replaced by his usual signature smile.

The other two male guests stood with him, and after hearing the program rules, they went to choose their breakfast.

Pei Ning immediately sidled up to Qiao Song and raised her hand to the director, "Director, I'll take Qiao Song's breakfast!"

Lu Jinxiao was shocked, his eyes filled with disbelief.

He never imagined Pei Ning would take the initiative to approach Qiao Song!

The usually aloof and beautiful Qiao Song showed absolutely no resistance to his advances.

What... what was going on?

Lu Jinxiao knew very well that even if it was just acting for the cameras, Pei Ning didn't have that kind of acting skill.

He clenched his fingers, his expression shifting between anger and uncertainty.

The director was in a dilemma. "But we're a male-female couple, and besides, if you two are together, there'll be one less person—"

"I don't care, I was with Qiao Song yesterday."

Pei Ning grabbed Qiao Song's arm, looking as if it were her right. "Qiao Song and I are a match made in heaven, we should be a couple! Besides, I love her breakfast, and she loves mine!"

The director was on the verge of tears, almost blurting out, "Please, have mercy on me!" Live comments: "Hahaha, this is the first time I've seen a director driven crazy by a guest."

Live comments: "Say nothing, Pei Ning and Qiao Song are such a perfect match! The aloof, powerful woman and the sweet, adorable girl are just too irresistible!"

Live comments: "Disgusting, this young lady is making money off the lesbian community, isn't that disgusting enough?"

Lu Jinxiao, seeing the awkward atmosphere, was about to speak when Qiao Song said, "I have no objection. We had a great time yesterday. Anyway, no matter how we choose, one person will be left out. We can choose each other, there's no problem with that, right?"

Her words carried a hint of coercion.

No one could refuse a cold, beautiful woman like her.

The director glanced at Lu Jinxiao, who stood to the side looking like a fool, then at Pei Ning and Qiao Song, who exuded perfect chemistry. He rubbed his temples and waved, "Alright! After breakfast, go choose your tasks!"

Pei Ning hugged Qiao Song tightly, holding their breakfast and feeding each other.

Lu Jinxiao: "..."

Ignored by everyone, Lu Jinxiao watched Pei Ning feed Qiao Song with a fork.

Lu Jinxiao swallowed hard, turning his gaze back to the director. "Director, what about me?"

The director paused, then scratched his head. "Xiao'er, why don't you work alone today? Someone has to be alone eventually, and at least two girls can look after each other, right?"

Lu Jinxiao gritted his teeth: "...Fine."

After breakfast, they had to draw lots to choose their money-making task for the day.

Director: "Each partner will send one person to draw lots. Whatever money you draw is your choice of earning method; you can't change it midway. Tonight, the order of choosing your confession gifts will be determined based on how much money you earn."

Pei Ning raised her hand. "What kind of gifts are there?"

The director blushed slightly and waved his hand. "Bring the gifts here!"

A row of waiters brought in the gifts. Pei Ning glanced at them.

"A crystal bracelet, a swan necklace, couple's mugs—"

The other guests' expressions varied when they saw the remaining gifts.

Female guest Nie Suisui looked shocked. "A bouquet of wildflowers, a handwritten letter, and a leaf…?!"

This thing looks utterly unpresentable!

She complained, "Director, are you trying to cut costs?! Is our production team that poor?"

The director just smiled and remained silent. Pei Ning pointed to the crystal bracelet on the first plate, "That's moonstone! Qiao Song, how about I win it and give it to you?"

Qiao Song, who had been sitting with his arms crossed, raised an eyebrow, "You like it?"

Pei Ning nodded repeatedly, "It's so beautiful!"

Qiao Song With an air of absolute certainty, she said, "Then I'll give it to you if I win."

Comments: "A love that flows in two directions! Go for it, Grandpa! Grandpa's the member this season! For sure!"

Comments: "The yuri dynamic is so sweet, their interactions are killing me!"

Comments: "Pei Ning is so cute! She's adorable from head to toe! She and Qiao Song are such a perfect match!"

Lu Jinxiao looked at the two with a complex expression.

When it came to the lottery to determine how to earn money, the first two couples drew "busking" and "selling toys."

Pei Ning asked the director nervously, "Director, what are the rest?"

Director: Hey lady, here's the script for you?

Seeing Pei Ning's expectant eyes, the director rubbed his nose. "Some are good, some aren't so good, it depends on luck."

Pei Ning turned to Qiao Song, "Qiao Song, good luck! You have to draw the one I like!"

Qiao Song glanced at her, but without hesitation, stepped forward and drew a card. Turning it over, she saw it was a barbecue stall.

Pei Ning hugged Qiao Song tightly, "Qiao Song, you're amazing! We'll have something good to eat again!"

Qiao Song instinctively put his arm around her waist, then looked at Lu Jinxiao, who hadn't drawn a card yet. Lu Jinxiao's gaze burned for a moment, but seeing her cold and indifferent attitude, Lu Jinxiao stepped forward dejectedly, rubbing his hands together to draw.

Pei Ning muttered under her breath, "Scumbag, making money? He should be begging!"

The next second, Lu Jinxiao drew a card. When he saw the words on it, his expression changed drastically, and everyone looked on with curiosity.

When Lu Jinxiao flipped the card over, everyone saw the large black characters "Be a Beggar." Although everyone tried to remain polite, they all burst into laughter.

Pei Ning: "..."

She never thought her sharp tongue would actually come true.

Lu Jinxiao stared at everyone with a deathly pale face. Pei Ning was currently nestled in Qiao Song's arms, the two whispering to each other, seemingly in a good mood.

Lu Jinxiao gripped the card tightly, showing no outward sign of distress, but inwardly he was burning with rage.

What's wrong with these two women?

So he's here to be a clown?
