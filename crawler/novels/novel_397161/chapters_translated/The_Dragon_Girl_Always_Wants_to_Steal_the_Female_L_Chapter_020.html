<h1>Chapter 20</h1>

Chapter 20

Pei Ning remained silent, as if transported back to a long time ago.

Back then, she was just a little carp, carefree, diligently leaping towards the Dragon Gate every day.

She understood nothing.

She had no companions.

At first, some of her kind befriended her, but after a couple of days, they gave up.

Some abandoned the path they sought.

Some willingly entered the cycle of reincarnation.

Back then, she never felt lonely.

Because from birth, all she needed to accomplish was "leaping over the Dragon Gate."

Her parents had her brothers and sisters by their side.

Her brothers and sisters could experience the mortal world together.

They didn't need her.

She was the one abandoned, burdened with a mission.

She thought that leaping over the dragon gate would bring her liberation.

But she never expected that the leap wouldn't bring liberation.

Now, Pei Ning felt a little lonely.

“Why did you jump into the sea during a live broadcast?! I'm going to pursue legal action against the production team and that Pei Ning! This has even made the news! Oh, my daughter's in trouble, and I'm the mother who only finds out later? People who don't know might think you and that Pei Ning committed suicide together!”

Pei Ning's head throbbed from the woman's voice.

She felt the voice was very familiar, and upon closer inspection, oh dear, wasn't that Qiao Song's mother?

The tone, the choice of words.

Pei Ning frowned, then opened her eyes.

The noise suddenly stopped.

Qiao Song, her lips pale, leaned closer to look at her, her fingers gently touching her forehead, an indescribable joy in her eyes. "Awake?"

Pei Ning blinked at her, shifted her body, and found herself refreshed after a good night's sleep.

Pei Ning slowly sat up.

Mrs. Qiao sneered, "Good that you're awake! Miss Pei, it seems our last conversation didn't teach you a lesson. I said then, from now on, Qiao Song—"

Qiao Song's face darkened, and he was about to shoo her away when a woman's voice rang out from outside the door, "Oh dear, let me see who's farting here? Don't stink up my baby!"

Just then, a beautifully dressed young woman walked in.

She looked to be in her early thirties.

The woman saw Pei Ning on the hospital bed, gasped softly, and quickly pushed past Qiao's mother to get closer. "Baby, Mommy heard you fell into the sea! Are you alright?! Let Mommy see if you're hurt anywhere!"

Pei Ning: "...Qingtuan, don't think I won't recognize you just because you're in someone else's body."

Qingtuan: "..."

She paused, then, with a fake smile, patted Pei Ning's head and chuckled, "What's wrong?" "Oh, you've become mute after being submerged in water? What did Mommy teach you? Mommy said that if anyone bullies you, you should bully them back as much as you can! Our family is rich, we're not afraid of these scoundrels!"

The woman whispered in her ear, "I'm here to help you, don't be ungrateful."

Pei Ning: "...I've never seen a system dare to speak to its master like that."

Telling her not to be ungrateful?

Where did Qing Tuan get the guts?

Caught off guard by this sudden blow, Mrs. Qiao was completely bewildered. Her expression changed. "I'm here to see my daughter, what business is it of yours? How can you be so rude?"

"Mrs. Pei," arms crossed, looked down at her with an air of superiority. "I'm also here to see my daughter, what business is it of yours?"

Pei Ning and Qiao Song shared a hospital room. Qiao Song, wearing a hospital gown, looked displeased. Seeing that Mrs. Qiao was about to speak, she stood up, her tone cold. "I didn't invite you here. Thank you for your concern, but please take your things and leave."

She wasn't joking.

Mrs. Qiao's mouth opened slightly, as if she wanted to say something, but she seemed heartbroken by Qiao Song's words.

She was furious, but wanted to maintain her last shred of elegance. Gritting her teeth, she glanced at Pei Ning and her daughter, then glared at Qiao Song, "Don't come crying to me later when you regret this!"

Qiao Song remained silent, watching her leave the ward.

"Mother Pei," with a quick tact, shifted her body. "Oh dear, I still need to go see the doctor to ask what's wrong with my baby. Um—"

She pointed a delicate finger at Qiao Song. "Xiao Song, could you please stay here with my baby? She's never had such a fright before."

Qiao Song's tense face relaxed slightly. She nodded politely. "Don't worry, Auntie, I'll take good care of her."

"Mother Pei" smiled and left with her bag. Pei Ning watched as she closed the ward door before leaving, and couldn't help but roll her eyes. Then, turning her head, she met Qiao Song's haggard face.

Pei Ning: "..."

She lowered her head, adopting a "go ahead and scold me, I'm guilty" posture. "Qiao Song, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to jump into the sea, I just, I just..."

The more she tried to explain, the less she felt she could express herself clearly.

The next second, a sweet breath filled her nostrils. Qiao Song pulled her into his arms, pressing her back tightly as if afraid she would disappear soon, as if trying to engulf her entirely.

Pei Ning was stunned for a moment.

She was a little confused about the situation, and could only tug at Qiao Song's sleeve, somewhat bewildered, "Qiao Song..."

"It's a good thing you're alive."

Qiao Song placed his hand on her back, his chin rubbing against her shoulder, a sense of relief washing over him. "Pei Ning, if anything had happened to you, I would have been devastated."

Qing Tuan: "Master, the progress bar is 75%! Keep it up! We're just a tiny bit away from perfection!"

Pei Ning: "That easy?"

Pei Ning: "As expected of me."

Pei Ning blinked, letting Qiao Song hold her like that.

She hadn't expected anyone to care about her.

Pei Ning couldn't help but laugh out loud.

Qiao Song released her, staring at her laughing face, his brows furrowing tightly. Even without makeup and looking extremely tired, Qiao Song was still the most beautiful in Pei Ning's eyes at this moment.

Qiao Song was displeased, "What are you laughing at?"

She was actually laughing at such a serious moment?

Pei Ning was a little embarrassed, meeting her gaze with a shy smile, "I'm laughing at myself."

She chuckled, her small hand tugging at Qiao Song's slender wrist, and whispered in Qiao Song's ear, "I just feel... I'm quite happy."

Qiao Song glared at her, seemingly still not satisfied, and raised her hand to pinch her chubby cheek.

The moment she met Pei Ning's radiant smile, all her anger vanished inexplicably. She hesitated to use her strength, only managing to gently touch Qiao Song's cheek.

Pei Ning moved closer, observing her expression, her feet brushing against the hem of Qiao Song's hospital gown. Before she could retreat, Pei Ning opened her arms and hugged her tightly.

Pei Ning smelled the disinfectant on Qiao Song's clothes.

She looked up, her eyes bright, her voice pleading, "Don't be angry, I won't do it again next time, okay?"

She was so obedient, it was impossible to be harsh with her.

Qiao Song didn't know what was wrong with her; her heart was pounding rapidly. For a moment, it felt like her heart was being squeezed. Her mind went blank for a second, then she lowered her head.

She met Pei Ning's wet eyes. She placed a light, gentle kiss on Pei Ning's lips.

It was a fleeting touch, yet it stirred ripples across the water.

Pei Ning's long, dark eyelashes fluttered, like a cat being soothed, a hint of surprise mixed with enjoyment.

She stared at Qiao Song's face, sat up straight, and leaned her head up, placing a slightly dry kiss on Qiao Song's cheek.

Qiao Song stiffened.

Pei Ning covered her mouth and laughed, "Qiao Song, you forgive me, right?"

Qiao Song didn't speak, only his eyebrows curved slightly; his slightly upturned phoenix eyes were as gentle as could be.

The program team issued an apology statement after Pei Ning woke up.

The team apologized for choosing the beach for their nighttime date and explained Pei Ning's decision to jump into the sea.

When netizens learned that Pei Ning jumped into the sea to save someone, their emotions became very complex.

Before Pei Ning woke up, there were many rumors online, the most widespread being that Pei Ning was possessed by a ghost and acted irrationally.

This theory circulated online, and netizens even provided seemingly logical analyses.

They listed all of Pei Ning's previous behaviors and fabricated claims that if Pei Ning woke up normal, it was because her family had spent a lot of money hiring a Taoist priest.

Pei Ning: "..."

This is outrageous.

The program was forced to halt its live broadcast midway through, undergoing a major overhaul. The higher-ups ordered everyone to reflect on the issues. The director, terrified, came to visit Pei Ning with fruit, flowers, and supplements after learning she had woken up.

Actually, the director wasn't to blame at all. After all, it was Pei Ning who jumped into the sea and rescued her.

It wasn't the director who forced her.

It's just—

For the sake of generating buzz, having an artist participate in a live broadcast in an inappropriate environment is inherently unreasonable.

After this incident, fans dug up the segment from the previous episode featuring Pei Ning and Qiaosong Ancient City, and then revisited the first episode.

Many people are targeting the director, mocking the program's irrationality.

Wu Xi Wutong: "Let me tell you a joke, they're participating in a dating reality show."

No. 36 Little Lemon: "It's good to straighten things out. Look at how badly the other couples are tearing each other apart, does anyone even care?"

Mancao: "If all else fails, let's do something else. Turning a dating reality show into an adventure is really something else."

Although the couple's fans want to see more interaction between the two, given the current state of the show, if it's not controlled, who knows where they'll be sent next?

Pei Ning felt a little guilty. If she hadn't suddenly gone to rescue someone, the show would have continued smoothly.

So when the director arrived with gifts, Pei Ning looked apologetic. "Director, I'm so sorry, I've caused you so much trouble this time..."

"No, no, you've done a great job this time."

The director was also a little embarrassed. "The mother and daughter who were drowning are mostly recovered. The mother said she thought she was going to die, and if you hadn't jumped in and saved them in time, maybe—"

Two lives would have been lost.

Pei Ning's lips curled into a smile.

Youth League: "Master, you are so handsome! You saved two lives as a trainee dragon girl!"

Pei Ning: "Hehe, as expected of me."

She was a little proud and secretly glanced at Qiao Song standing next to her. Qiao Song's originally calm face turned to Pei Ning when she heard the director's words.

That look was a little helpless, but also a little warning.

Pei Ning quietly avoided her sight, feeling guilty for no reason.

Pei Ning: "I lost Qiao Song's roses the other day, and I haven't had a chance to pay her back yet. Will Qiao Song be angry about it?"

Qing Tuan: "?"

Pei Ning: "However, I suspect Qiao Song is also a carp spirit. Otherwise, why is she always 'sharing weal and woe' with me?"

Qing Tuan: "??"

Pei Ning: "'Sharing weal and woe'? You don't understand? She's looking at my mouth..." "My lips are so dry, so you need to moisturize them for me. When I was still a little carp, only my two closest fish would do this."

Pei Ning: "Qiao Song is so sweet."

Pei Ning: "Waaah."

Qing Tuan: "..."

Qing Tuan: "…………"

—
The live broadcast was paused. Pei Ning, feeling fine, completed the discharge procedures.

Back in Beijing, Qiao Song prepared to join the film crew, engrossed in packing her luggage in her room. She didn't let Xiao Hua into the room; she handled these things herself.

Pei Ning tilted her head and peered through the doorway.

Qiao Song is so beautiful!

Slim waist, long hair, pencil-thin legs.

Her ponytail was casually tied; she was beautiful even without makeup. Qingtuan: "...You plan to stay here all day?"

Pei Ning then realized she had a mission.

Pei Ning: "Don't panic, I can do it!"

She clutched a white rose, bit her lip, "Joseon..."
