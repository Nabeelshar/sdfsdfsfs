Chapter 15

Qiao Song didn't know why, but she followed Pei Ning.

Sitting in the taxi, Pei Ning leaned against the window, watching the street scenes rushing by, occasionally exclaiming softly, "The light show is so beautiful!"

It was hot in Beijing, and the driver hadn't turned on the air conditioning. The window was rolled down, and the wind tousled her hair, causing Pei Ning's ponytail to sway back and forth behind her head.

Qiao Song silently fiddled with her phone case, turned it on to check the time, then turned it off again.

Hmm…

It was eleven o'clock.

She lowered her head, her eyes downcast, her curled eyelashes fanning her face.

Pei Ning turned around and was immediately stunned by her beauty. She quickly sat up straight and silently moved closer to Qiao Song. Qiao Song lifted her eyelids to look at her; the beauty mark made her eyes appear much softer.

Pei Ning gave her a silly smile.

Qiao Song: "..."

Pei Ning, seemingly oblivious to her strangeness, played with her fingers, fiddling with each one, gently pinching the fingertips, turning them over and over for a while. Then, Pei Ning wrote on her palm.

Pei Ning tilted her head to look at her. "Qiao Song, guess what I wrote?"

Qiao Song, flustered, tried to pull her hand away, but Pei Ning held her wrist and traced the words on her palm again.

Her fingers were soft as she slowly drew on Qiao Song's palm, her expression serious. Qiao Song noticed her bright eyes and a wide smile.

Qiao Song relaxed a little and leaned back in his seat. "I don't know."

"It's a 'dream.'"

Pei Ning said seriously, "Everyone has their own dreams. No one is born dreaming. Some people may live their whole lives without ever knowing what their dream is. But Qiao Song, you're amazing."

Qiao Song turned to look at her. The wind outside the window tousled her hair, and the wind whistled past her ears. She rolled the car window up a little more.

A hint of sadness flickered in Qiao Song's eyes. "What's so great about me?"

Reborn, she wanted to stick to her path, but difficulties remained.

She loved acting and didn't want to give it up.

It was her lifelong pursuit.

"You've found your dream, but I haven't."

Pei Ning stared at her intently, her eyes shining.

"You've always been on the path of pursuing your dream. You can give up many things, but you've never given up your passion. To me, that's truly remarkable. Not many people can persevere in their passion, but you can, and you've done it very well."

She smiled, a smile more heartwarming than the night breeze.

“I want to give you this ‘dream.’ If one day you want to give up, you can pick it up and continue to bravely move forward!”

Qiao Song’s heart pounded like a drum.

Qing Tuan: “…Little brat, you’ve even learned to give people pep talks…”

Pei Ning: “Hehe, I saw it on the public account today. I’ll share some more with Qiao Song later!”

Pei Ning: “How about it? How about it? Is Qiao Song feeling a little better?”

While eating hotpot, Qiao Song went to answer the phone, and she felt something was off until she heard that arrogant female voice on Qiao Song’s phone.

She lowered her head, biting into seaweed, not daring to cry in front of the cameras, but inwardly she was furious. Why did such an outstanding girl like Qiao Song have to be scolded like this?

She thought Qiao Song would cry, but when Qiao Song came out of the bathroom, she was unchanged, still with that gentle, serene demeanor, as if nothing cared, nothing could stir her emotions.

Pei Ning felt a pang of heartache.

Qiao Song was already so, so very good.

Yet, no one loved her.

“Even if one day someone forces you to give up, you must stick to your path.”

Pei Ning leaned on the chair, looked up at her, her eyes squinting in the wind, and smiled sweetly. “All the good things in the world deserve to be possessed by you.”

Qiao Song’s expression was somewhat subtle, but her heart was in turmoil.

She hadn’t expected Pei Ning to say such cheesy words, and she hadn’t expected Pei Ning to be so thoughtful. He hadn’t said a word on the plane, yet he had used this way to make her strong.

She didn’t know what Pei Ning had seen through, she only felt a hole in her heart, one that had been bleeding, the scab reopening and hurting, but with Pei Ning here…

the pain subsided.

Like a potent medicine, it slowly healed her wounds, making her feel—

that perhaps this world truly was worthwhile.

Pei Ning smiled at her. Qiao Song blinked, glanced out the car window, and a tear slid down her cheek. She quickly wiped it away, trying to hide it. When she turned back, Pei Ning was already holding her waist, her head buried in her chest.

She heard Pei Ning whisper, "I'm here."

Qiao Song felt inexplicably at peace.

That ship that had been adrift for so long seemed to truly—

have a home now.

Pei Ning owned a small villa in Beijing, arranged for her by the Pei family. It was a three-story villa of over 500 square meters in a prime location, with a security system comparable to the best in the country.

Qiao Song followed Pei Ning into the house, carrying two suitcases. Pei Ning's house was usually cleaned by a housekeeper, and Aunt Zhang usually looked after things, but today she had also chased Aunt Zhang away, leaving only her and Qiao Song in the house.

Pei Ning offered to let Qiao Song sleep in the bedroom with her, but Qiao Song felt uncomfortable and insisted on sleeping in the guest room.

After washing up and lying in bed, Qiao Song kept her phone in airplane mode.

She knew that once Qiao's mother said she would stay at the apartment, she wouldn't give up easily. This stubborn attitude was very similar to when she filled out her college application. Qiao's mother insisted on secretly changing all her applications to law schools while she was sleeping.

Without even asking if she was willing or if she liked it.

She connected to the villa's Wi-Fi and logged out of WeChat.

Now that she wouldn't receive any messages from the Qiao family, her mood improved considerably.

Then she logged into Weibo and saw that her and Pei Ning's hashtags were trending. Clicking on the recommended posts showed videos of the two of them.

She also went to the "Delivery Couple" supertopic.

The couple fans were having a blast, but some fans also came to harass them. The couple fans launched into scathing attacks, and one comment became the most popular, receiving over 500 likes.

"Please deliver and get married on the spot!" "Hilarious! If Qiao Song didn't like Pei Ning, would he have filmed two episodes with her? Don't fool yourselves, Qiao Song didn't say she didn't like her when she dragged Pei Ning onto the small wooden table! You two have the guts to make Qiao Song marry you!"

Although the camera didn't capture much, the two of them crawling on the small table still charmed many people.

Qiao Song watched them bickering, her head spinning.

Just as she was about to swipe away, she saw someone had drawn a picture of her and Pei Ning together.

Clicking on it, she saw it was quite well drawn.

She saved it without thinking, but before exiting, her little finger accidentally liked a Weibo post, which she didn't see.

Qiao Song turned off her phone, put on an eye mask, and went to catch up on sleep.

She hadn't slept much in the ancient city for the past two days, and sleeping on that straw mat left her aching all over the next day.

Perhaps Pei Ning's comforting words had an effect; her worries lessened, and she fell asleep quickly.

In the middle of the night, she felt a furry body in her arms, but didn't pay much attention, turning over to hug the soft, warm bundle.

When the sun was high in the sky, sunlight streamed in through the French windows. Qiao Song lifted her eye mask, rubbed her eyes, and saw Pei Ning obediently holding her, nestled in her arms like a well-behaved child, even her lips were upturned in her sleep.

Qiao Song's brain went blank for a few seconds, but she quickly recovered, pushing Pei Ning away and sitting up.

Pei Ning was pushed and grumbled a few times in dissatisfaction. She rubbed her eyes, still half-asleep. Seeing Qiao Song sitting on the bed, she drowsily opened her arms towards him, "Hug."

Qiao Song threw back the covers to get out of bed, but Pei Ning scurried over and wrapped her arms around her neck. Qiao Song had no choice but to hold her.

She patted Pei Ning's back and gently lifted her hair. Pei Ning lazily draped her arms over her shoulder, her head resting on Qiao Song's shoulder. After only a few seconds, she fell asleep again.

This time, Qiao Song didn't dare move.

Pei Ning slept very peacefully, her breathing soft. She wasn't heavy at all.

Qiao Song felt like she had explosives strapped to her body, every step she took was extremely cautious.

She slowly lay down, turning to her side, her arms around Pei Ning's waist, patting her back lightly.

Pei Ning snuggled into her embrace, seemingly catching a fragrance, and even took a deep sniff while still half-asleep.

Just a moment, and she quickly fell asleep again.

Qiao Song stared blankly at the ceiling until 11 a.m.

She didn't know why she was staring at the ceiling. When Pei Ning rubbed her eyes and woke up, she was finally able to get up. Seeing the script on the table, Qiao Song stiffened.

She was supposed to meet the director today.

The appointment was at 8 a.m., and it was already 11 a.m.

Qiao Song was unusually flustered. She quickly washed up and got ready, turning on her phone to call her assistant, but her phone kept buzzing with notifications.

"Suspected confirmation of their relationship: Qiao Song and his girlfriend were spotted holding hands and returning to their love nest late at night!"

"Is it real? Qiao Song and Pei Ning are just one step away from officially announcing it!"

"The two of them liked a photo together, personally confirming their relationship! Fans are going crazy!!!"

Qiao Song: "???"

She thought the company's upper management must be furious. They already wanted to sideline her, and now being in a relationship wasn't a good thing. Maybe her manager was already frantically searching for her and about to explode.

Qiao Song logged onto WeChat, and sure enough, her phone started ringing non-stop. Her mother had sent her hundreds of messages.

She didn't have time to check, so she simply put her mother on Do Not Disturb.

Her manager did contact her, but something was a little different.

[7:00 AM]

Agent: "Are you ready? Xiaohua said she can't reach you and doesn't know where you went last night. Give me an address, and I'll have her pick you up."

Video call not answered—

Voice call not answered—

After a dozen or so voice calls.

[8:00 AM]

Agent: "Qiao Song, you're finished! You won't get any more roles! Playing with directors like this is no different from digging your own grave!"

Qiao Song's heart skipped a beat. He was trying to figure out how to salvage the situation when he saw the message below and froze.

[8:20 AM]

Agent: "Holy crap! Qiao Song, what's wrong with you?! Director Zhang Yimei said you don't need to audition for his film!!!"

Agent: "He said it was the eldest daughter of the Pei family who personally recommended you!!! She went to see him last Friday, and she gave you all your information!"

[8:30 AM]

Agent: "The director had someone send me the contracts, saying you just need to come out, sign them, and have a meal when you have time."

Agent: "...What luck! This time you're not just the second female lead, you're definitely the leading lady!"

Qiao Song's fingers clenched tightly as she thought of last Friday.

That afternoon, she saw Pei Ning.

Pei Ning's eyes were red and swollen. She saw Pei Ning's van but pretended not to see it; she heard Pei Ning call her name but pretended not to hear it.

It turned out that Pei Ning had worked hard for her dream that day.

She finally understood the meaning of Pei Ning's words, "I'm here for you."

Qiao Song went downstairs with mixed feelings.

Seeing Pei Ning, who had finished cleaning, angrily chopped the tomatoes into a pile of tomato puree.

Seeing her come downstairs, Pei Ning's eyes lit up. She rubbed her stomach, looking utterly aggrieved, "Josong, I'm so hungry."

Josong gave her a deep look, then silently walked over. "...I'll do it."
