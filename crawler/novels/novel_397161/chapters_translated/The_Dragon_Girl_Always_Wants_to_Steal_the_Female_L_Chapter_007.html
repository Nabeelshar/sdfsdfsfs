<h1>Chapter 7</h1>

Chapter 7

Qiao Song had been observing Pei Ning for a whole day.

She initially thought this woman was approaching her to sow discord between her and Lu Jinxiao, but from morning until now, Pei Ning's gaze hadn't lingered on Lu Jinxiao for even a second longer.

Although she was still wary of Pei Ning, she had no intention of hitting this smiling woman.

After all, the Pei family held considerable influence in the circle, and she wasn't foolish enough to openly offend Pei Ning.

Seeing her sweet smile, Qiao Song casually replied, "I'm currently negotiating a project, and I'll probably be in Beijing for the next couple of days."

She paused, noticing Pei Ning's interested expression, and asked, "What about you?"

It was just a casual question; she wasn't particularly concerned about Pei Ning's work schedule.

Pei Ning immediately replied, "I'll go back to Beijing with you!"

Pei Ning was from Shanghai. Her family doted on her, showering her with resources from the very beginning of her career. Holding her hand, Pei Ning looked at her expectantly, "Qiao Song, what project are you going to discuss? Tell me, maybe I can help!"

Qiao Song frowned slightly, feeling a little uncomfortable.

She subtly withdrew her hand, her tone unconsciously turning cold. "Thank you, no need. You should get some rest. Thank you for the gift. Goodnight."

She then went back to her room without inviting her in.

Pei Ning looked bewildered. "Did I say something wrong? Why does Qiao Song seem angry?"

The translucent green dumpling bounced from the floor to the doorknob, its round, green body twirling around on the handle like it was doing a pole dance.

Qing Tuan: "That's normal, Master. The original owner had plenty of top-tier resources from the start, yet despite her terrible skills, she was incredibly prolific, constantly making low-quality films to disgust audiences. Even so, she wasn't famous."

Pei Ning: "...So?"

Qing Tuan: "Didn't I tell you, many of those stolen resources belonged to Qiao Song?"

If it weren't for Pei Ning, Qiao Song would have been famous long ago.

There wouldn't be any chance for Lu Jinxiao to mentally control her.

Pei Ning patted her cheeks, "What a mess..."

No wonder Qiao Song's face darkened immediately when she offered to help.

It's like she took away Qiao Song's full rice bowl, scolded the food as unpalatable while eating in front of Qiao Song, and then playfully asked the hungry Qiao Song if he needed her help ordering some food.

So shameless.

Qingtuan: "But the gang still needs help. The original owner has suppressed Qiao Song many times before. Many people in the industry are afraid to approach her for filming, so she came to participate in this love drama to increase her exposure. If you, the owner, don't step in, it will be very difficult for her to get resources."

Peining: "...I am simply not a human being."

She finally knew how good Qiao Song was in acting.

If you treat people like her with such courtesy, you may have lost all your ancestors who scolded her in your heart.

Pei Ning: "This is so hard, so hard. So, these past two days, Qiao Song might just have been acting for me, not actually liking me?"

Qing Tuan: "...If you were her, would you like the original owner?"

Pei Ning: "...No."

She would have seized the pulse of the original owner's fate the moment she saw her, blasted her to smithereens, and then whipped her a thousand times over to vent her anger.

Unfortunately, she wasn't Qiao Song.

Pei Ning was a little disappointed. "So, her giving me a perfect score was fake, saying she liked me the most was fake, even the gesture of giving me the necklace was fake."

She didn't know why, but her nose felt a little sore.

Qingtuan: "...So you're only pretending to like her to complete the mission, aren't you? Think about it, do you really like Qiao Song?"

Pei Ning was stunned for a few seconds.

She blinked, watching Qing Tuan sit on the doorknob, exhausted from flipping through the pages. She muttered, "I really do like her."

Pei Ning: "Qiao Song is beautiful, independent, and has a strong personality. She's sincere and gentle. Would anyone not like her?"

Pei Ning shook her head. "Except for a blind jerk like Lu Jinxiao, no one would dislike her, right?"

Qing Tuan: "Anyway, you're just doing a mission right now. If one day you find that you really need her, can't live without her, and that it's not just a friendly relationship, then you might be at a disadvantage."

Qing Tuan: "Because it seems that Qiao Song doesn't like you that much right now."

Pei Ning: "..."

Pei Ning returned to her room dejectedly.

Standing behind the door, Qiao Song heard her departing footsteps and narrowed her phoenix eyes slightly.

Qiao Song took a shower and packed her luggage, preparing to return to Beijing the next morning.

Just as she finished packing, her WeChat notification sounded.

She glanced at it and saw it was from Pei Ning.

To facilitate communication during the show's recording, they had added each other on WeChat. Her Moments were empty, so she hadn't blocked anyone.

Pei Ning, on the other hand, had abandoned her usual flamboyant and extravagant style, setting her Moments to only be visible for the last three days, and leaving it completely blank.

Qiao Song grabbed a towel to dry her still-wet hair and tapped on Pei Ning's profile picture.

Pei Ning changed her profile picture from a selfie to a beautiful red and white striped koi.

Pei Ning: "Qiao Song, I'm sorry."

Qiao Song's fingers paused. She wanted to send a question mark, then an ellipsis, but thinking of Pei Ning's tearful expression, a cold reply seemed inappropriate.

She scrolled through her collection of emojis; she didn't have many. After selecting a few sets, she returned to the chat window and saw a long message from Pei Ning.

Pei Ning: "I've done many things that hurt you in the past. Those things are unforgivable and irreparable in my eyes. The damage I caused you can't be easily erased. I don't want to wipe the slate clean; I just want you to give me a chance to atone."

Pei Ning: "I want to be friends with Qiao Song, not just friends who disappear after the show. I want to share my joys and sorrows with Qiao Song. The affection I expressed for Qiao Song on the show wasn't from my heart." "On a whim."

Pei Ning: "This might seem a bit childish and a bit inexplicable to you, Qiao Song, but I'm saying this very seriously. I really like Qiao Song and don't want to lose you as a friend."

Pei Ning: *crying emoji*

Pei Ning: "I know netizens say I'm not good enough for you, that I'm terrible, but I'll slowly change. Let's start as ordinary good friends, Qiao Song, okay?"

Ordinary good friends?

Qiao Song almost laughed.

This woman, does she think she's fishing?

Setting up a bigger trap, hooking a bigger bait?

Qiao Song thought for a moment and replied, "Okay."

Just one word, but it was a response.

Pei Ning seemed overjoyed; Qiao Song's phone kept ringing.

Pei Ning: "That's great, Qiao Song!"

Pei Ning: "From now on, we're super, invincible best friends! Anyone who dares to break us up, I'll make them explode on the spot!"

Pei Ning: "Explode on the spot is a new word I learned today! Qiao Song, our relationship is now a very harmonious shady deal, right?"

Qiao Song: "???"

Qiao Song: "Kid, don't use words you don't know."

Pei Ning: "Hehe/"

With their relationship becoming this harmonious, Pei Ning's mood improved considerably. She had originally planned to return to Beijing with Qiao Song, but by the time she woke up, Qiao Song was already gone. Pei Ning could only have her assistant arrange the return trip. Her assistant wasn't always available; she was notoriously difficult to work with. Later, the Pei family arranged for their nanny to take care of her.

At the airport, she bumped into Lu Jinxiao. Lu Jinxiao forced a smile, his usual assertiveness from the previous night's WeChat message gone. "Ningning, what a coincidence! I booked first class today. We'll both be in the VIP lounge later, right? How about we chat?"

Pei Ning put on her sunglasses, raised her chin, and arrogantly replied, "No way. We're not in the same lounge. I'm chartering a plane back."

Without waiting for Lu Jinxiao's reaction, she swayed her hips in her high heels and walked away without looking back.

Lu Jinxiao's face turned pale, then red.

Qingtuan: "These kinds of men are the best at relentlessly pursuing someone, Master, you need to be careful he doesn't cling to Qiao Song!"

Pei Ning: "..."

Yeah, although Lu Jinxiao is a scumbag, blind, and bad guy, Qiao Song was originally supposed to like him.

Even if she blocked their communication in the dating show, she couldn't guarantee they wouldn't have a chance in private!

Pei Ning quickly searched online.

A little while later, Pei Ning sent Qiao Song a link.

Pei Ning: "Sharing the article 'Which Types of Men Should You Avoid? Here are a Few Things to Help You See Through Men's True Colors'"

Pei Ning: "Sharing the article 'A philandering man can ruin your career and family; good women should share this!'"

Pei Ning: "Sharing the article 'Modern-day scumbags' common flirting techniques; girls, open your eyes wide!'"

Qiao Song: "..."

Qiao Song: "Sharing the article..." "What to do if your account is hacked? Here are a few tips to easily recover your WeChat account."

Qiao Song: "Sharing the article 'Telecom Fraud Prevention: Never Click These Links!'"

Qiao Song: "Sharing the article 'Beware! You've Been Targeted by Scammers! Never Forward or Share This Type of Article!'"

Pei Ning: "Hehe/"

Back in Beijing, Qing Tuan created a learning plan for Pei Ning.

Since she was going to stay in the entertainment industry, she needed to learn the skills of an artist.

Qing Tuan locked Pei Ning in a small dark room for three days and three nights, specifically to cultivate her acting skills.

Those three days and three nights outside the small dark room were equivalent to three months inside.

Even if Pei Ning were a complete idiot, her acting skills could still improve. Besides, she's quite talented; otherwise, she wouldn't have gotten into acting at such a young age.

After she came out of the small dark room, Qing Tuan was finally somewhat satisfied.

Qing Tuan: "This way, when Qiao Song goes to film, you can join the crew with her. At least you can be together and continue your rescue work. While I don't expect you to act exceptionally well, at least you won't have the same expression throughout the entire series like before."

Pei Ning: "..."

She had seen the original actress's performance.

Her face looked like she had a facial paralysis no matter what role she played.

Directors with even a modicum of taste wouldn't use that kind of acting.

But there were quite a few people in the industry with acting skills like hers.

She'd seen it all.

They were mostly spoiled brats like her, or young, handsome, and beautiful men trying to make as much money as possible to supplement their retirement income.

Even if they were criticized by the audience and netizens, they didn't care.

After all, they got paid once the show was filmed.

They really didn't care what the audience saw or what their opinions were.

Pei Ning felt a tightness in her chest.

She had also seen Qiao Song's work.

Qiao Song was a natural-born actress.

Unfortunately, Qiao Song had too few resources. After the original owner gave the order, the company didn't pay much attention to her and seemed to want to abandon her. Apart from a few award-winning films she made early in her career, the quality of the productions she received afterward dropped drastically. Qingtuan: "Master, tonight, Qiao Song is attending a dinner party to meet the director of 'Lingxiao.' The original owner disliked this film, but the production quality is quite good. This is Qiao Song's best resource right now."

Pei Ning, exhausted, collapsed on the bed. "Does she even have a chance?"

Qingtuan: "She originally had a chance, but the original owner's cousin interfered. That cousin of yours, he's always a bit of a blockhead. He'll probably make things difficult for Qiao Song tonight."

Pei Ning jumped up in shock. "He wouldn't dare!"
