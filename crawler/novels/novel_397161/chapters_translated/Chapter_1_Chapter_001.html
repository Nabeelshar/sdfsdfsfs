Chapter 1

“Pei Ning, congratulations on passing the Dragon Gate Advancement Exam and obtaining the qualification for Dragon Maiden Internship. Internship data is loading, please wait—”

“Dragon Maiden Intern Pei Ning: Carp Cultivation, 2001 years old. Dragon scales not yet complete, dragon horns not yet complete, dragon claws not yet complete. Must descend to the mortal realm to cultivate and increase merit. The Heavenly Court Tracking System has been installed. System loading, please do not exit the program.”

Pei Ning nearly coughed up blood. She had been tumbling at the Dragon Gate for two thousand years, and now, having just leaped in, she had become a bald dragon?

"System loading complete. Greetings, Master. I am Qing Tuan, the Heavenly Dragon Tracking System. Your consent is required for my mortal cultivation mission, 'The Beautiful, Tragic, and Powerful Heroine Rescue Plan.'"

A semi-transparent Qing Tuan hopped to Pei Ning, its voice cute and innocent, "If you successfully rescue a beautiful, tragic, and powerful heroine, you can exchange for equipment once. Once all equipment is exchanged, your internship will end, and you will be upgraded to a qualified dragon girl!"

Two buttons, "Agree" and "Cancel," appeared in front of Pei Ning.

Pei Ning: "I think being a dragon girl isn't so great. Low pay, lots of work, no holidays a year, and the retirement age has been postponed recently—"

Without hesitation, Pei Ning pressed the "Cancel" button. A flash of white light appeared before her, and everything went black.

A voice, brimming with excitement, rang in her ears: "Congratulations, Master, for choosing the mission 'Saving the Beautiful and Miserable Heroine Project 3.0 Upgraded Version'! The first plane is loading. We wish you success in completing the mission!"

Before Pei Ning could utter a sound, her mind went blank, and the next second, she heard a cacophony of voices.

"What's Pei Ning up to? The show's already started broadcasting live. Is she calling Qiao Song out to spout threats?"

"The rich girl, she thinks she's something special just because her family's rich. I heard she forced this role in for Lu Jinxiao, insisting the director force her in."

"Shameless! She wouldn't be trying to bully Qiao Song, would she?"

Pei Ning had sharp hearing; she could clearly hear the whispers from several rooms away. She opened her eyes and saw a woman standing before her, wearing a black halter dress, her expression cold and aloof.

The woman had long, wavy, dark blue hair and was at least 1.7 meters tall. Her features were exquisitely sculpted, her skin fair and beautiful. Her phoenix eyes looked down at her slightly, and there was a small beauty mark at the corner of her eye.

She exuded charm at first glance, yet wasn't cold-hearted. A small, egg-sized green dumpling, perched on the woman's shoulders, held a mission card and said to Pei Ning, "She's Qiao Song, the female lead you're supposed to save this time!"

Pei Ning immediately recalled Qiao Song's profile card—

Qiao Song, a rising star actress with solid acting skills, has won three Best Actress awards. After working with male lead Lu Jinxiao on the film *Spring Night*, their relationship became ambiguous, and their love deepened. Later, the supporting actress Pei Ning interfered, and Lu Jinxiao, unwilling to let go of the wealthy heiress Pei Ning, cheated on her with two women.

On Lu Jinxiao's birthday, a rainy night, Qiao Song rushed back from out of town to celebrate his birthday, hoping to salvage their relationship. While driving alone on the elevated highway, she received a call from Lu Jinxiao.

On the other end of the phone were the loving voices of Lu Jinxiao and Pei Ning. Qiao Song, losing control, slammed on the gas, jerked the steering wheel, and the car flipped over the overpass. She was only twenty-six years old.

Pei Ning looked at her with a complex expression.

Qiao Song, her face cold, gripped the woman's wrist, watching helplessly as this woman, who had been arrogant and domineering just a moment ago, now radiated maternal love.

Qiao Song's hand trembled slightly, her eyelids lifting casually, and she asked coldly, "What are you doing?"

Even though she had been specifically summoned to the garden, this place was always covered by cameras. This dating reality show was being broadcast nationwide, and its popularity was considerable.

The program had done a special pre-show promotion; with her and Lu Jinxiao present, the popularity was guaranteed to be high. Half an hour before the official live broadcast, the cameras were already on.

Countless netizens were watching intently.

In her previous life, Pei Ning and Lu Jinxiao had an ambiguous relationship, and Pei Ning repeatedly warned her to leave Lu Jinxiao. Based on how things unfolded in that life, if this woman had called her out, she would not only have verbally abused her but also slapped her.

In her previous life, this matter caused a huge uproar, but it was ultimately resolved thanks to this woman's family background.

Qiao Song's gaze towards Pei Ning grew even colder.

Qingtuan, the female protagonist, rattled off a bunch of plot details: "Master, the original owner summoned Qiao Song to provoke her. You can't anger Qiao Song now; you have to become good friends with her! Make her trust you and like you!"

Pei Ning: "..."

Isn't it just showing weakness and trying to be friendly? She knows how!

Qiao Song tightened her grip on her wrist. "What did you want from me?"

Pei Ning, half a head shorter than her, gritted her teeth, made up her mind, her eyes reddened, and she cried out innocently and pitifully, "It hurts!"

Qiao Song raised an eyebrow, mindful of the cameras, and released her hand. But unexpectedly, the moment her hand loosened, the woman pounced on her, burying her face in her chest.

"Waaaaah! Qiao Song, I love you so much! Your movies are all so good! Can you give me your autograph?"

Viewers who were watching the drama unfold on their screens, discussing whether the two women were fighting, turned around to see the two women hugging.

Comments: "???"

Comments: "No way, no way, Pei Ning just called Qiao Song out with a fierce look on his face just to get an autograph?"

Comments: "Is this the kind of scene I get without paying?"

Qiao Song froze. She hadn't expected Pei Ning to hug her! This was completely different from her previous life!

Qiao Song instinctively tried to pry her arm away, but Pei Ning looked up at her, her dark eyes brimming with tears and a pitiful expression. "Qiao Song, I really, really like you so much."

Afraid she wouldn't believe her, Pei Ning drew a huge circle in front of her, "That much, that much, that much I like."

Qiao Song: "...Childish."

Her voice was very low, and Pei Ning pretended not to hear. Seeing this, he tilted his head to look at her. The faint scent of milk wafted into Qiao Song's nostrils. Qiao Song regained her composure, and her tone became more normal. "You called me out just for this?"

"Of course not!"

In Pei Ning's view, as long as Qiao Song didn't interact with Lu Jinxiao, she wouldn't fall for him. And as long as she didn't like Lu Jinxiao, the tragic ending wouldn't happen!

Qiao Song had a "I knew you were going to cause trouble" look on her face. Unexpectedly, the next second, Pei Ning grabbed her hand and said with utmost seriousness, "I still want you to be my CP!"

Qiao Song almost stumbled and fell to the ground.

She suspected she'd been reborn and her hearing and brain were failing her. Afraid she'd misheard, she exclaimed, "Huh?" Pointing her finger at Pei Ning, then at herself, she asked uncertainly, "You and me?!"

In her previous life, she and Lu Jinxiao were paired up on this show, and therefore, there were quite a few fans online who shipped them as a couple.

Pei Ning blinked her eyes like stars, her expression subtly ingratiating as she took Qing Tuan's hand and whispered sweetly, "I came to this show for you, Qiao Song, you won't refuse, will you?"

Her innocent and harmless demeanor left Qing Tuan speechless. "Master, how come I never realized a carp spirit could be such a good actress?"

Pei Ning: "...If you dare mention 'carp spirit' again, I'll skin you alive."

Qing Tuan: "That'll have to wait until you grow dragon claws! Master, you're a little bald dragon right now!"

Pei Ning's face flushed red with anger.

Comments: "I have to say, Pei Ning's shy little face is really cute, hahaha!"

Comments: "Seriously? Even the young lady is trying to ride this wave of popularity? I'm taking my Qiao Song away, Qiao Song won't earn this dirty money."

Comments: "To be fair, this is the first time I've really appreciated the young lady's looks. She's actually quite adorable when she doesn't just read numbers or slack off on stage."

Pei Ning: "..."

She hadn't realized a supporting actress could be this bad.

Pei Ning, fearing Qiao Song might refuse, was about to say something more when Qiao Song's lips curled into an extremely faint smile. "Okay."

Pei Ning thought she had misheard, both surprised and delighted. "Really?! You agreed?!"

A hint of sarcasm flashed in Qiao Song's eyes. He probably guessed that Pei Ning was afraid she would choose Lu Jinxiao, which was why she made such a nonsensical, even outrageous, request.

She knew the Pei family's strength; they were indeed not someone she could withstand alone.

Qiao Song said casually, "It's okay, as long as you can convince the director, I'm fine with anyone."

Pei Ning beamed, patting her chest to assure her, "No problem! I'll go ask the director, he'll definitely agree!"

Qiao Song felt disgusted, thinking, "Who's going to agree with us?"

But she remained calm, watching how long Pei Ning planned to keep up the act.

Just then, the production crew called them to gather in the front hall.

Pei Ning excitedly grabbed Qiao Song's hand and, as expected, went to discuss it with the director. Ever since she confessed to Qiao Song, the live stream's popularity hadn't waned. The director had been monitoring the netizens' comments, and seeing that they weren't too opposed, he agreed to Pei Ning's request.

The show was originally planned to have three couples paired up, but Pei Ning suddenly joined the competition. Everyone thought she was going to compete with Qiao Song for Lu Jinxiao, but unexpectedly, before Lu Jinxiao even arrived, Pei Ning had already taken Qiao Song's hand.

The two of them were paired up to complete a first impression scoring process, leaving them with only eating and shopping for the rest of the afternoon.

This is the basic formula for dating variety shows.

Comments: "This is outrageous! I've never seen a dating variety show with a yuri (lesbian) couple. Does the director need a magic weapon?"

Comments: "Ugh, I'm so angry! Qiao Song is the only one who matters! Pei Ning, let go of your dirty hands!!!"

Comments: "Speaking of which, this is a dating variety show. Didn't the production team consider what would happen if Lu Jinxiao showed up?"

The comments section fell silent. A few seconds later, Lu Jinxiao arrived.

The other guests had already teamed up to complete their tasks.

Lu Jinxiao, dressed casually in a specially chosen casual outfit, stepped out of the van.

Lu Jinxiao's immense popularity in the entertainment industry is undeniable, his good looks and air of aristocratic elegance are undeniable. Upon exiting his car, he went straight to the pre-arranged location to wait for the female guests.

He knew, of course, that his assigned guests this time were Qiao Song and Pei Ning.

He admired Qiao Song's talent, but also needed Pei Ning's family support.

Choosing either one would be unfair to the other.

Lu Jinxiao agonized over who to choose in the garden for over an hour before realizing neither of them had appeared. With darkness falling, he couldn't sit still any longer.

The assistant director, watching Lu Jinxiao fidgeting like a quail in the garden, realized a guest had been forgotten.

He called the director for instructions, who yelled on the other end, "Why are you still filming him! Let him go back to his room and sleep. Quickly bring more people to the mall!"

The hashtag #QiaoSongAndPeiNingHoldingHandsShoppingAtTheMall has gone viral on Weibo.

In the mall, Pei Ning licked her lips, staring intently as the ice cream was carefully prepared and handed to her by the server.

Pei Ning tilted her head, glancing at Qiao Song leisurely eating her ice cream. Imitating her, she took a small bite, almost crying with happiness, "So delicious!"

The little bald dragon was eating ice cream for the first time, almost moved to tears by its heavenly flavor. Cameras were following them. Qiao Song watched her act, a cold smile playing on his lips as he thought, "I'm so naive, I've never seen anything like this before." His expression remained gentle as he took a tissue and moved closer to her.

Pei Ning instinctively flinched. Qiao Song pressed her shoulder, gently wiping the ice cream crumbs from the corner of her mouth.

Even if it was just acting in front of the camera, she wanted it to be flawless.

Qiao Song's fingers were slender and beautiful. His cool fingers brushed against her lips, and his phoenix eyes were slightly lowered. Pei Ning's heart raced, and she almost stopped breathing.

Pei Ning: "I think Qiao Song doesn't really dislike me? Becoming good friends with her is just around the corner!"

This task doesn't seem so difficult after all!

Qing Tuan: "...Putting everything else aside, Master, you have a pretty good attitude."

Pei Ning snorted, looking up at Qiao Song, only to meet Qiao Song's gaze. Even though she showed no emotion whatsoever, Pei Ning's face shamefully turned completely red!

Qiao Song raised an eyebrow slightly, surprised that she was such a good actress.

Despite her discomfort, Qiao Song tossed the wad of tissue into the trash can, wishing she could wipe her fingers with rubbing alcohol hundreds of times. Her voice was indifferent. "Are you this happy just eating ice cream?"

Pei Ning nodded emphatically, giving her a sweet smile. "Because you bought it for me, Qiao Song, it's so sweet! It tastes like Qiao Song!"
