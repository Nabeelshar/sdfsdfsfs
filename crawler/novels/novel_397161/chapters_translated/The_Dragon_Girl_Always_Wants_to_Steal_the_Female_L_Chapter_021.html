Chapter 21

Josong heard the noise and turned to look at her. "What's wrong?"

The room was well-air-conditioned. She was wearing a white shirt and pencil pants. As she bent down to fold her clothes, two fingers of milky-white skin peeked out from her waist.

Pei Ning hesitantly approached, fidgeting. "Could you grant me a request...?"

Josong raised an eyebrow. Pei Ning, embarrassed to look at her, handed her the white rose. "I want... to join the crew with you."

The progress bar was already 75%.

Victory was in sight.

She had to keep going!

Josong looked at her with her arms crossed, wondering if she had misheard.

Pei Ning quickly explained, "The show's canceled, I can't act, and no one's approaching me for work. Plus, you can't stay with me."

She blinked pitifully, her round, almond-shaped eyes seeming misty. "Can you take me to a film crew?"

Qiao Song turned around, his expression hidden. "You still need acting roles?"

Pei Ning's brain froze for a few seconds.

Qingtuan: "Master, she's mocking you for taking her resources before!!!"

Pei Ning's eyes reddened, and she lowered her head, sobbing, "She doesn't lack acting opportunities, but she's never acted with Qiao Song before."

Pei Ning's shoulders trembled as she continued, "That director only likes talented actors like Qiao Song, he looks down on people like me. I want to act well too, but no one teaches me. If Qiao Song takes me to the set, I can act with him, sob..."

Qingtuan: "She's been persuaded! She's turned around!"

Qiao Song turned to look at her, lost in thought.

Pei Ning looked up, pouting, "Isn't that enough?"

Tears welled in her eyes. Qiao Song glanced down at the white rose in her hand, feeling a pang of pity. "Acting is hard work, you're doing well here."

"But you'll be gone for months!"

Pei Ning nearly burst into tears. "I won't see you for months!"

How was she supposed to progress her story like that?!

She didn't want to go bald like this!!!

Qiao Song hesitated. "Then I'll go talk to the director...?"

Pei Ning stopped crying, her eyes brightening. "Really?"

Qiao Song took the white rose, turned to find a vase, and sunlight streamed in through the window, causing the curtains to flutter.

“I need to ask the director.”

Qiao Song placed the white rose into the blue-and-white porcelain vase on the desk, flicking the petals with her fingers. “Many roles were cast in advance, so there might not be any suitable ones for you—”

She turned to look at the pitiful-looking Pei Ning, not saying anything more hurtful, and coughed. “This drama is a patriotic one, so it'll be quite tough. The director is aiming for awards, so his standards will definitely be much higher…”

In short…

This drama is very different from the idol dramas Pei Ning has acted in before.

Pei Ning's fingers twisted together, "I'm okay..."

She moved closer to the desk, hugging Qiao Song from behind. Noticing Qiao Song stiffen, she whispered, "I just want to be with you, even if I'm just an extra, I'll be happy..."

Qing Tuan: "Being an extra is impossible, absolutely impossible! The eldest daughter of the Pei family becoming an extra would be a laughing stock!"

Pei Ning: "...Have you no manners?"

Pei Ning: "Of course I wouldn't just be an extra!!!"

She just wanted Qiao Song to pity her more!

Qingtuan: "Oh, oh."

Pei Ning: "Rolls eyes/"

Qiao Song licked her lips, her slightly cool fingertips brushing against Pei Ning's burning arm. She sighed helplessly, "...Okay."

Pei Ning tilted her head back, nuzzling against her shoulder. Just as Qiao Song was about to pinch her fingers, she let go and ran off with lightning speed, "Qiao Song, I'm going to pack my bags too! Wait for me!"

Qiao Song: "..."

Really, flirting and then running away?

-
"A Century of Glory" is a tribute film. The director and screenwriter are highly respected in the industry. When Pei Ning first approached the director about the film, she brought all of Qiao Song's information, and with the help of the Pei family's connections, she finally got the director to agree.

This drama doesn't have a single main character. Qiao Song has a significant role, but as an ensemble piece, each actor could easily carry a show on their own.

Vivid, documentary-style, yet not boring—that's the drama's stylistic aim.

Someone like Pei Ning, a "resource-backed" actress whom netizens find tiresome, simply doesn't deserve to be in this drama.

Even the most popular stars have to take a backseat.

Let alone her?

I don't know how Qiao Song communicated with the director, but after sending messages and making phone calls, she went to find Pei Ning.

Pei Ning was busily packing her luggage in her bedroom.

Qiao Song only packed one suitcase, but Pei Ning had five neatly arranged in her room.

Qiao Song: "..."

She couldn't help but ask, "Are you planning to spend the New Year on set?"

Pei Ning turned to look at her, grinning foolishly, "I packed so many things you like!"

She pointed to a suitcase full of snacks and sauces, "Film crews don't have regular meals, so I packed your favorite scallop and mushroom sauce, beef and bamboo shoot sauce, and some chicken leg mushroom meat sauce. Ugh, they're all delicious!"

Pei Ning pulled out each suitcase, explaining to her, "Here are the face masks, skincare products, and beauty devices I prepared for you. I heard filming this movie is tough and damaging to the skin, so these custom-made ones are very effective. They'll definitely work for you. I brought three months' worth, that should be enough!"

Qiao Song silently walked behind her. Pei Ning plopped down on the floor and rummaged through the remaining suitcases.

“There are also supplements for those all-nighters. Bird's nest and fish maw are a must, grape seed extract for whitening, and collagen is essential too. I can't ruin your health. Money can never be earned enough, and filming can never end. I also packed toys and a game console in this suitcase, so you can—”

Before she could finish, Qiao Song hugged her tightly.

Pei Ning nestled in Qiao Song's arms, smiling sweetly as she looked up at her. "Qiao Song, aren't I amazing! I did so much research on all of this; it's all stuff you like!"

Qiao Song's fair, smooth cheeks flushed. She didn't dare look down, only clinging to Pei Ning, staring at the pile of suitcases in front of her. "So many! Aren't you too lazy to carry them all?"

She always traveled light when filming.

Once on set, she adapted to local customs, using whatever she had, without being so particular.

Besides, before this, even if she wanted a bit of extravagance, she hadn't had the opportunity.

“These bodyguards can carry them, you don’t need to lift a finger, Qiao Song.”

Pei Ning muttered softly, staring at the suitcase in front of her for a few seconds in thought, then suddenly sat up straight. “I also prepared vitamins, I’ll go get them!”

Qiao Song pressed her down.

Both were slender, but Qiao Song was taller. His movement pushed Pei Ning back to her original position. Pei Ning lost her balance on one elbow, half her body leaning against the edge of the bed, her back against the wall, while Qiao Song’s arm was around her waist.

The position was too intimate. Qiao Song looked down at her, and Pei Ning seemed to hear his heart pounding.

Qingtuan: "The progress is so slow..."

Qingtuan: "Master, give it your all!!!"

Pei Ning: "..."

She's practically a mother to Qiao Song already, how much more effort does she need to put in?!

Pei Ning met Qiao Song's slightly narrowed phoenix eyes. Qiao Song's gaze held an indescribable complexity, the beauty mark on her face making the emotions appear even more intense. Then, the next second, Qiao Song's head slowly lowered.

Pei Ning watched as her face slowly drew closer, her dark, curled eyelashes trembling slightly, like butterfly wings.

Pei Ning's breathing was shallow. She bit her lip, leaned against the edge of the bed, and slowly placed her right hand on the spot where Qiao Song's heart was pounding.

Through the fabric of her shirt, her hand was warm and soft, and Josong's breath caught in her throat.

She pressed Pei Ning's hand down, her eyes deepening with emotion.

Pei Ning's eyes were hazy. Just as Josong's lips were about to brush against her nose, she gently moved the hand holding Josong's.

"Josong, is your heart not well?"

Josong paused.

Pei Ning looked at her questioningly, "A normal person's heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute, Qiao Song, your heart rate is almost 140!"

Pei Ning frowned slightly, her concern evident, "Are you feeling unwell?"

Qiao Song: "..."

Her ears turned red, and she slowly withdrew her hand, "No, I'm fine."

"Then how can your heart be beating so fast? If you're in this state, you might not be able to handle the high-intensity filming."

Pei Ning frantically searched for her phone, "I'll ask Aunt Zhang to register me at the hospital!"

She got up to find her phone, but Qiao Song pressed her down, her tone helpless, "...I'm fine."

Pei Ning looked at her with a "how could that be?" expression, "If a rapid heartbeat isn't taken seriously, it can lead to palpitations, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing later on." "Difficulties, some serious, even requiring heart surgery, how can you be okay!"

Qiao Song: "..."

She rubbed her temples, amused and exasperated. Seeing her unconvinced and still laughing, Pei Ning sat up straight, hands on her hips, and said fiercely, "What are you laughing at! I'm very serious, okay! If even you don't take care of your body, no one else will care about you." "!"

She hummed twice, stood up, and reached for Jossong's arm. "I need the doctor to give you a full checkup! You have to be alright!"

Jossong's smile didn't fade. He raised his chin to look at her, his arm lazily draped over his shoulder. "So afraid something will happen to me?"

"Of course!"

Pei Ning was both nervous and serious. If something happened to Jossong, her mission would fail, and what would be the point of her playing around?!

"You're still laughing!"

Pei Ning frowned, stood up to help Qiao Song stand, "Get up, let's go to the hospital!"

With this pull, Qiao Song stood up, and Pei Ning lost her balance, falling backward. Qiao Song tried to lift her, but couldn't support her weight and pushed her onto the bed.

Pei Ning cried out twice, "Qiao Song, you're pressing on my flesh!"

Qiao Song's hand was under her. Hearing Pei Ning's words, she tried to pull her hand away, but Pei Ning was pressing down too firmly, and she couldn't. Pei Ning used the bed as a support to lift her waist, creating a gap, but her nose brushed against Qiao Song's lips.

Jossong's breath hitched, a faint lemon scent wafting over and landing on Pei Ning's chin.

Pei Ning whimpered, clutching Jossong's collar, "It hurts so much, Jossong, your hand is digging into me!"

She grumbled, "I told you to eat more and gain some weight, otherwise it wouldn't hurt so much!"

She looked at Jossong with a pitiful expression. Jossong looked down at her, her red lips slightly parted as if to kiss her, when suddenly the door slammed shut, followed by Aunt Zhang's panicked voice, "I didn't see anything! Ladies, please continue!"

Jossong: "..."

She glanced at the doorway; clothes were scattered all over the floor. Aunt Zhang must have been collecting the clothes to pack Pei Ning's suitcase.

Her ears turned bright red, and she glanced awkwardly at Pei Ning, who grinned at her with a bright smile.

Qiao Song: "..."

She quickly got up and straightened her clothes. "I'll go pack my luggage."

After a few steps to the door, she turned back to look at Pei Ning, whose hair was disheveled and who looked completely innocent.

Qiao Song looked away. "By the way, the director said he agreed to let you join the crew with me."

Pei Ning's eyes lit up.

This is wonderful!
