Chapter 9

Pei Ning: “…That sounds so difficult.”

Qiao Song had already said he didn't like Lu Jinxiao, but the rescue mission hadn't been completed. This meant that simply getting rid of Lu Jinxiao was completely useless.

Pei Ning felt like dying.

More than the mission failure, she was afraid of hurting Qiao Song's feelings.

The second episode of "The First Time I Met You" was filmed in an ancient city in the north.

Unlike the water towns of Jiangnan, the northern ancient town was completely devoid of the elegance of Jiangnan, possessing a rich and rugged atmosphere.

The ancient buildings were magnificent, and the city walls stretched as far as the eye could see.

The production crew's cars were parked outside the city gate.

The afternoon sun wasn't so strong at five o'clock.

Pei Ning sat in the van, letting the makeup artist apply an ice-covered towel to her eyes. "Why are they so swollen?"

The nanny, Aunt Zhang, muttered, "I don't know what happened. This morning they were horribly swollen. Anyone who didn't know better would think she'd been beaten up."

Pei Ning closed her eyes to rest. "Hasn't Qiao Song arrived yet?"

Aunt Zhang gave her a hand mask, her movements delicate, applying a specially made ointment with rose petals to the back of her hands, starting from her wrists and working her way down to her fingers.

The ointment was as white as milk.

The scent of milk and roses was a little cloying in the van.

"Maybe he won't come? I heard even that handsome guy surnamed Lu didn't come last time. What a pity, Miss, didn't you like him quite a bit?"

Aunt Zhang laughed, "It's his good fortune to be liked by our Miss!"

Pei Ning denied it, "I don't like that kind of person."

Pei Ning was nervous and secretly asked Qing Tuan, "Isn't Qiao Song coming today?"

Qing Tuan: "How could that be? She doesn't have any acting roles right now, and besides, she signed a full-term contract with the production team. If she doesn't come, they'll have to pay her, and she doesn't have that much money."

Pei Ning: "...That's terrible."

It seems like Qiao Song's misfortune is all her fault.

Aunt Zhang massaged Pei Ning's hand casually, saying, "That handsome guy looks good at first glance, but upon closer inspection, he's not a good match for you, Miss. Even playing around with him would lower your standards. If you fancy someone, just tell the master and mistress; they won't stop you."

Pei Ning: "..."

She wasn't that impulsive!

Just then, someone outside called out, "Teacher Qiao is here!" Pei Ning sat up abruptly, almost bumping into the makeup artist's head. The makeup artist exclaimed, "Ouch! Miss, what's wrong now?"

Pei Ning raised her hand, removed the towel, and pushed Aunt Zhang away, preparing to leave.

The car door was open. Her eyes were still a little swollen, and the rings around them were red from the long ice packs, making her look like a big panda. She peeked out, but didn't see Qiao Song. Just as she was about to get out, she caught sight of Qiao Song, already made up and hair-dressed, walking towards the director with the staff. She hurriedly called out, "Qiao Song!"

Her voice was quite loud.

Qiao Song slowed his pace slightly, tilting his head slightly in her direction, but ultimately didn't turn back, walking directly towards the director.

Pei Ning was furious and incredibly aggrieved.

Aunt Zhang called out, "Little rascal, your hands are covered in flower mud and you're touching everything! Such a child!"

Pei Ning's nose stung, and she shrank back, feeling a pang of sadness.

Forty minutes had passed by the time she was ready.

Everyone was waiting for her. As soon as the director saw her arrive, he immediately started a live stream.

The live stream's popularity skyrocketed.

The number of viewers quickly soared to seven or eight million.

Comments: "Hahaha, I'm here! Sisters, my happiness is back!"

Comments: "I've waited a whole week for this day!!! My favorite couple is so sweet!"

Comments: "The goose is wearing a cute little dress today, so pretty!!!"

Pei Ning was wearing a modified cheongsam today, with a bow in her hair, looking absolutely adorable.

After the host's introduction...

Director: "Today, it's the same as last time. Qin Chen paired with Nie Suisui, Sun Qiuming with Tang Weiwei, and Pei Ning with Qiao Song. Any objections?"

Pei Ning secretly glanced at Qiao Song standing beside her.

Today, Qiao Song was dressed casually in a white T-shirt and wide-leg jeans, wearing a baseball cap. Her curly hair was down, and she exuded youthful beauty. She was still quiet, just smiling at the camera.

Pei Ning thought to herself, Qiao Song smiled more in front of the camera than in front of her.

Pei Ning looked away and nodded vigorously, "Yes, that's right!"

The director said, "Then let me explain the game rules. Once you enter the ancient city, you're officially in the game. This time, the theme is zombie escape. You six will split into three groups. The game starts from the moment you step through the city gates and ends at 8:00 AM on Sunday. The camera crew and drones will be with you the entire time, but they won't provide any assistance."

He read the rules aloud, "The three teams need to spend one day and two nights in the ancient city. During this time, you must find the production crew within the ancient city..." "The group with the most hidden gold leaves will determine your travel expenses for the next episode. The group with the fewest gold leaves will be severely punished by the production team."

He paused, "Participants attacked by zombies can use gold leaves to exchange for medicine to heal their wounds. However, if there are no medicine, or not enough medicine to treat your wounds, the attacked person will turn into a zombie and be separated from their partner. Other participants who successfully snipe the attacked person will receive an additional five hundred gold leaves."

Everyone trembled in fear.

Comments: "Holy crap, it's like the clique killing each other! The director's too ruthless!"

Comments: "Hahaha, can you guys still ship these couples? When disaster strikes, everyone flies away. Let's see who's unlucky this time!"

Comments: "The unluckiest person is gone now, good luck to all the darlings!"

Nie Suisui weakly raised her hand, "What's the punishment with the fewest gold leaves?"

The director smiled mysteriously, "You'll find out later, but I bet you'll never want to try it."

The director coughed and continued, "All the food and water in the ancient city need to be exchanged for gold leaves. If you don't have gold leaves..." "You'll be starving in here for a day and two nights."

Comments: "Holy crap, the director's ruthless!"

Comments: "Am I here to watch a survival show or a dating reality show?"

Comments: "Stop yelling, the director's other show is a werewolf game, hahaha!"

Pei Ning hesitated, "How are we supposed to find the gold leaves?"

The director, looking憨态可掬 (endearingly simple-minded), "You'll find out when you get in."

Pei Ning: "..."

Their phones were confiscated, each pair was given a walkie-talkie, but everyone carried a bag representing their identity, used to collect the gold leaves.

And they had no weapons to fight the zombies.

Pei Ning thought this game was a bit difficult.

Qingtuan: "It's alright, Master. You're useless, but you're always lucky. You're the chosen one! There won't be any problems!"

Pei Ning: "...I don't know if you're comforting me or provoking me."

The director reminded him: "You can also try to steal the other team's gold leaves. Anything you get before the game ends will go into your own wallet."

Pei Ning was dumbfounded.

So, not only do you have to guard against zombies, but also against other zombies, and then you have to work to earn your own lunchbox.

Pei Ning was speechless. "Are you afraid there will be newcomers next season, or are you only planning to do this one season?"

This is really going to kill you!

The director had a "You didn't expect this, did you? I'm just messing with you guys" look on his face. Pei Ning just wanted to strangle him.

“Before entering the city, everyone will wear a watch showing your and your partner's positions. Also, if one person dies, the other person's watch position will no longer be updated.”

After explaining the rules, the director looked at everyone expectantly, “Have fun!”

Pei Ning and Qiao Song both wore pink watches.

Pei Ning gave Qiao Song a sweet smile. Qiao Song glanced at her, quickly looked away, and said very politely, “Let's go.”

Although the interaction continued, the feeling of unfamiliarity and distance was even stronger than on the first day.

Pei Ning pretended not to notice and followed Qiao Song into the city.

As soon as the city gate opened, the group stepped inside and saw an old man standing on a makeshift stage.

Beneath the stage lay a dense mass of bleeding soldiers.

The old man, his hair disheveled, wore a black military uniform riddled with arrows, his red robe tattered.

His face was covered in blood. Gazing at the soldiers lying on the ground, tears streamed down his face, his grief and anger mingling: "Blades clashed as we fought for the mountaintop, blood rained down, soaking our battle robes! I, Li, have spent my life fighting for my country, slaying countless Xiongnu! Today, I have been defeated on this frontier! Warriors! My good sons! Today, I will lead you back to Chang'an!"

"Boom!"

"Boom boom!!"

"Boom boom boom!!!"

The old general, holding drumsticks in both hands, struck the upright war drum with all his might.

The soldiers lying on the ground began to twitch their fingers. Pei Ning was still stunned, watching the scene unfold, when Qiao Song grabbed her and pulled her away, yelling, "They've turned into zombies! Run!!!"

Pei Ning was dragged along, one of her shoes flying off.

Pei Ning screamed, "My shoe!!!"

But it was too late. The zombies behind them were already getting up one after another. Pei Ning didn't care about her shoe anymore; she simply threw off the other one and ran as fast as she could, wearing only her socks.

Comments: "Hahaha, his shoe fell off in fright!!! Joshong's reaction was so quick!"

Comments: "I'm still immersed in the scene just now, the production team is really dedicated!"

Comments: "To be honest, when I saw the cameraman's shaky camera, I knew Joshong was serious, hahaha."

The ancient city's streets are all interconnected, large and small, resembling a grid.

Qiao Song dragged Pei Ning along, running until Pei Ning was breathless. She heard the production crew announce over the walkie-talkie, "Golden leaves have appeared within 50 meters. Please collect them quickly."

Pei Ning, leaning against the wall, asked Qiao Song, panting, "Where are the golden leaves? Have you seen them?"

Qiao Song shook her head. Her eyes searched the area, and suddenly she saw a long string of golden leaves hanging from the city wall above them, like hanging chili peppers.

Pei Ning excitedly tried to grab them, but unfortunately, she wasn't tall enough; no matter how much she jumped, she couldn't reach them.

"This is so hard..."

Pei Ning looked around for a bench or a stone.

"It's too late."

Josong said coldly, "Hurry and pick the gold leaves, or they'll catch up. We can't let them take them."

After all, the gold leaves represent all the resources here.

Pei Ning looked distressed, but before she could speak, Josong had already squatted down. The next second, Josong grabbed her leg and stood up abruptly!

The two of them together were quite a bit taller!

Pei Ning gasped softly, almost falling, but she was light, and Josong could support her.

She strained upwards, hooked her finger, grabbed the rope holding the gold leaf, and pulled it down. Pei Ning almost cried out in joy, but before her happiness could last two seconds, she heard Nie Suisui's voice, "They got the gold leaf!"

Nie Suisui and Qin Chen had caught up with them!

Pei Ning whispered, "Run!"

She almost tumbled into a ball with Qiao Song. Clutching the gold leaf, Qiao Song pulled her along, and the two of them ran wildly, with Nie Suisui and Qin Chen hot on their heels.

Suddenly—

At the fork in the road, two zombies stood with their backs to them. Qiao Song grabbed Pei Ning and pulled her into a narrow alley. Nie Suisui and Qin Chen hadn't caught up with them before the zombies discovered them, forcing them to abandon their pursuit and flee.

Behind the closed wooden door, Qiao Song pounded on the lock, while Pei Ning leaned against it, panting.

Their position looked exactly like they were embracing.

Pei Ning was truly exhausted from running.

When she caught her breath, she looked up and saw Qiao Song peering through the crack in the door.

Qiao Song had already taken off her hat and casually tied her curly hair up. From running, her pale skin had a faint pinkish tinge, and you could even see the fine downy hairs on her face.

She was also panting, her chest rising and falling slightly.

Pei Ning tugged at her sleeve.

Qiao Song looked down at her; her phoenix eyes were beautiful, but at this moment they seemed a little lost, unsure of what she was doing.

The next second, Pei Ning fell into her arms, her hands tightly gripping her waist.

Pei Ning rubbed her nose against her clothes, her tone inexplicably coquettish, "Qiao Song, I missed you so much."
