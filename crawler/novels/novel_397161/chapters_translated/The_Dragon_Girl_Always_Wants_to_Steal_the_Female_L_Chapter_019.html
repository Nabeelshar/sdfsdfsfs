Chapter 19

"Qiao Song, where did you go?"

Pei Ning opened the menu. "I ordered these, all your favorites. Do you want anything else?"

Qiao Song has a small appetite and isn't picky about food because she eats little.

The photographer at the entrance took a close-up shot of Qiao Song holding a carefully wrapped bouquet of roses. "I heard that most people who eat here are couples, and they usually receive roses, so—"

Just now, when she entered the hall, she saw that every table of girls had received roses.

She secretly slipped out to buy a bouquet and changed into a dress.

She just wanted to make it feel more formal.

After all—

This was the first time she and Pei Ning had come to such a formal place.

They wanted to create some beautiful memories. Pei Ning suddenly realized, then feigned regret, "You wanted roses? I could have bought them for you. Why did you have to go out and buy them yourself?"

Qiao Song: "?"

Pei Ning pouted, displeased, "Are you looking down on me? You gave me so many seashells, and I wouldn't be so stingy as to not even give you a bouquet of roses. Next time, don't buy them yourself, I'll buy them for you!"

Qiao Song: "???"

Her expression was somewhat helpless.

Live chat: "Hahaha, is Chun Ning really unaware or just pretending? Those roses were bought for her by Qiao Song!"

Live chat: "Qiao Song is in a dilemma, he can't give them to her or not, hahaha!"

Live chat: "I can really relate to this, I'm starting to feel embarrassed for Qiao Song."

Qiao Song let out a barely audible sigh and shoved the bouquet of roses into Pei Ning's arms, "These are for you." Without uttering a single unnecessary word, Pei Ning pointed incredulously at the roses, then at herself, "For me?"

Josong raised an eyebrow, his expression seemingly saying, "You're not happy?"

Pei Ning immediately hugged the bouquet of roses, overjoyed, "So I can receive flowers too!"

She held the roses, looking them over from left to right, even sniffing them, acting as if she'd never seen anything like it before.

Josong: "..."

His acting was more refined than hers, just a little exaggerated.

No need to act so well!

Pei Ning smiled sweetly, muttering softly, "This is the first time I've ever received flowers."

She winked at Josong, "Thank you, Josong!"

Josong's heart skipped a beat.

Last time, Pei Ning said she had never received a gift.

This time, she said it was the first time she had received flowers. The renowned heiress of the Pei family had never even received roses.

This was very strange.

Despite many doubts, Qiao Song didn't show them, simply assuming Pei Ning was exaggerating.

While the two were dining, many fish swam around outside the glass enclosure.

Pei Ning took a bite of the steamed prawn, stealing a glance at Qiao Song. She asked, "Qiao Song, do you like fish?"

Qiao Song looked up at her, his phoenix eyes slightly raised. "What's wrong?"

Pei Ning grinned sheepishly. "Don't you think some fish are really pretty? I quite like them! Like some carp—"

Qiao Song picked up a pan-fried yellow croaker with his chopsticks, biting off the head. Pei Ning shuddered, hearing Qiao Song say calmly, "I don't know about pretty ones, but braised carp is quite delicious."

Pei Ning: "..."

You're doomed.

The conversation ended there; Pei Ning didn't want to make things awkward by asking her about fish again.

The screen erupted in laughter. After dinner, the director arranged for the two to take a walk on the beach.

Pei Ning: "..."

Why another walk? Is the director unwilling to give them any recreational activities?

Qingtuan: "Master, keep it up! Despite all your efforts today, your and Qiao Song's progress bars haven't increased at all!"

Pei Ning: "..."

Didn't it tell her already?!

Qingtuan: "A walk is a good opportunity to get closer to Qiaosong, and maybe she'll like you even more! Your relationship might progress at an accelerated pace!"

Pei Ning: "Could you teach me how to do it?"

Qingtuan: "If I knew how, I wouldn't have asked you to come."

Pei Ning: "...You're right."

The sea breeze was strong, and their skirts billowed in the wind.

Pei Ning: "I should have skipped dinner."

Qiao Song: "?"

Pei Ning: "Since the director's going to treat us to nothing anyway, why waste money on dinner?"

Comments: "Hahaha, the official commentary is the most lethal! They could have just gone back to the hotel and soaked in the pool!"

Comments: "It's so dark at the beach tonight, I don't know what the director was thinking, letting them walk like this all night?"

Comments: "...They'll catch a cold, won't they? They were in the sun for so long this afternoon, and now they're in the sea breeze at night. Did the director invite them on a trip, or to suffer?"

The comments continued, and Pei Ning thought the netizens were simply heartwarming angels.

And she thought so too!

Pei Ning, clutching roses, walked with Qiao Song against the sea breeze. The director winked at her, holding a cue card, signaling her to initiate a conversation, create a touching moment, and then embrace Qiao Song on the beach.

Pei Ning: "..."

If she wanted to hug, she would have done it already. Why wait here?

She rolled her eyes at the director, desperately wanting to go back to the hotel and sleep.

The sea breeze was a bit strong; all the tourists had gone home. The distance was a dark mass of sand. Pei Ning's flip-flops felt uncomfortable as sand burrowed into her toes.

Qiao Song noticed her impatience and walked over to the camera area, intending to tell the director they should return to the hotel. Just then, Pei Ning heard a loud cry for help—

"Baby! My baby! Ah!!!"

The cry for help was at least three or four kilometers away. With her exceptional hearing, she immediately heard the voice continuing: "Mommy's coming to save you!"

Then came the sound of a "plop" into the water.

It was so dark and late; the rescue workers on the beach had all gone off duty, and the on-duty personnel probably couldn't hear anything from there.

The sea wasn't shallow, and the waves were big. Even if someone jumped in to rescue someone, a single wave could capsize them, and the outcome might be uncertain.

The director agreed to return for the live broadcast and was preparing to have people pack up when Pei Ning, who had been standing quietly, suddenly jumped into the sea.

The water splashed violently.

A gasp rippled through the crowd. Qiao Song was still discussing the schedule with the director when she heard a crew member scream, "Pei Ning went into the water! Pei Ning jumped into the sea!"

Qiao Song nearly lost her balance. Coming to her senses, she turned and grabbed the equipment, stumbling towards the shore. Her assistant, Xiao Hua, quickly stopped her, "Sister Qiao! You can't go in! You're not a strong swimmer, you'll die!"

Qiao Song didn't care about that anymore. She struggled free from her assistant, glancing at the fallen red roses on the ground. "Pei Ning jumped in!"

She didn't know why Pei Ning had jumped into the sea. She had only turned around and exchanged a few words with the director.

She was inexplicably afraid.

She was afraid that Pei Ning, like her, had deliberately jumped into the sea.

Qiao Song broke free from Xiao Hua's arm and rushed into the sea without a second thought.

The live stream chat exclaimed: "Holy crap!!! This is a live stream mishap!!!"

The chat exclaimed: "Did you guys see Pei Ning jump into the sea?! Why didn't anyone notice she jumped in?!"

The chat exclaimed: "Qiao Song is really panicked! What happened to Pei Ning?!"

Before the chat could continue, the screen went black.

Live stream mishap, video paused.

Netizens were frantic.

Weibo and the hashtag were flooded with prayers for their safety.

#PeiNingJumpsIntoTheSea

#FirstTimeMeetingYouLivestreamAccident

#QiaoSongJumpsIntoTheSeaToSavePeiNing

Trending topics explode, views surge.

Major news websites are reposting the report.

YuanYuanBuYuan: "Waaaaah, I rewatched the video several times, and I saw Pei Ning jump into the sea in that instant! What happened to her? Why did she jump into the sea for no reason?!"

RuoJin: "QiaoSong isn't a good swimmer and is afraid of water!!! She actually jumped into the sea to save Pei Ning! Is this little fool alright?! Director team, can you please give us an answer?!" Fox Not Stupid: "So, production team, come out here and face the hell!!! Why did you put them on the beach so late and in such strong winds! And the waves are so big tonight! Aren't you afraid they'll get swept away and never come back?!"

Netizens were really making a scene. Even those who didn't follow the live stream or ship the two, at this moment, were worried for the two young and beautiful girls.

Qiao Qiao is Mine: "Waaaaah, if Qiao Song and Pei Ning return safely, I'll never scold Pei Ning again. I just hope the girl I love is alright."

Singing for You: "I always thought she was just acting for the camera, but now I know she really likes Pei Ning. I won't stop her anymore, I won't stop her anymore, Qiao Song, come back! After you come back, I won't stop you from loving whoever you want, waaaaah!"

When Will Qiao Song Marry Me: "For Qiao Song, no matter how late, the entire Ke Song team will wait for a response!"

Pei Ning transformed into a dragon in the water, his body rising and falling as he plunged into the sea, quickly finding the mother and daughter who had fallen in.

Her dragon form couldn't last too long, and without the protection of her dragon scales, the impact of the waves would be fatal.

Qingtuan: "Master, do you think it's worth risking exposure to save two mortals?"

If her identity is exposed, the mission will fail.

Pei Ning used her dragon tail to wrap around the mother and daughter, pushing them away with the tide.

The tide pushed them onto the beach.

She heard the exclamations of the production crew.

Pei Ning was running out of strength; she gradually shed her dragon form and returned to human form.

"I don't know."

She heard someone call Josong's name, knowing he had fallen into the sea. She flipped over and continued diving towards the seabed. "I only know that sometimes gods exist to protect their people."

Even if they didn't know who she was.

Pei Ning thrashed about in the sea.

Reverting to her physical body wasn't as effective as becoming a dragon, but her own strength was insufficient; she certainly couldn't transform into dragon form anytime soon.

She swam through the sea like a fish, sensing Josong's warmth and breath, and finally—

She saw Josong, his legs tangled in seaweed, unable to move.

Pei Ning's heart tightened. She stepped forward to pull at the seaweed, but the force caused her hand to split open, blood mingling with the seawater and staining the red gauze.

The wound healed quickly as the seaweed broke.

Pei Ning gripped Qiao Song's waist and, using her legs, lifted her up.

Qiao Song was almost out of breath; her eyes were drooping, as if only a slit could be opened.

Pei Ning pinched Qiao Song's chin and leaned in to give her air.

But she knew it was no use.

*Whoosh—*

Pei Ning emerged with Qiao Song in her arms. The crowd gasped and rushed over. Pei Ning, barely able to stand, laid Qiao Song flat and began performing CPR.

One breath, two breaths.

Three breaths, four breaths.

When Qiao Song exhaled a mouthful of seawater and her heartbeat gradually returned, Pei Ning breathed a sigh of relief, completely exhausted, and collapsed beside Qiao Song.

-
"Pei Ning, you are a carp spirit. You have lived for over two thousand years. Do you have a home?"

Pei Ning heard a faint voice, like a distant chant from the heavens.

Pei Ning kept her lips tightly closed, remaining silent.

"Your parents, your brothers and sisters, have all vanished like smoke in the past. None of them could attain enlightenment. Do you think you can overcome this tribulation and become a true Dragon Girl?"

Pei Ning: "..."

What, has this Bodhisattva Yi Lijing possessed her?
