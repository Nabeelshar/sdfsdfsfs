Chapter 16

Josong's cooking skills were quite good; he quickly heated the tomato puree into a sauce, stirred it with the shrimp, and then mixed it with the noodles.

Pei Ning leaned over the table, slurping the noodles with her chopsticks.

She ate with adorable manners, licking her lips after each bite before taking another.

Catching Josong's gaze, she smiled sweetly and gave him a thumbs-up, "So delicious!"

Then she continued slurping.

Josong tore off a tissue to wipe the sauce from her mouth, "Thank you."

Pei Ning paused, tilting her head to look at her, blinking in confusion.

She cooked the food, so why was she thanking him? "Thank you for the audition with the director," Qiao Song explained. "I heard you recommended me to him."

Pei Ning suddenly understood, letting out a long "Oh," and without a word, swallowed her noodles, took a sip of lemonade, and said confidently, "Because I think no one is more suitable for that role than Qiao Song. Your acting is excellent, enough to overshadow all the competitors."

Qiao Song was slightly taken aback.

Pei Ning trusted Qiao Song completely; after all, Qiao Song had won three Best Actress awards in her previous life.

Although she hadn't won a single award in this life, she had received nominations, which was a considerable achievement for a young actress.

Qiao Song currently lacks opportunities and, more importantly, confidence.

Pei Ning wanted Qiao Song to know that she was far more capable than she imagined.

The weather was gloomy at noon. After lunch, Pei Ning intended to go out, but a sudden downpour began. Qiao Song had no work scheduled besides the audition, and Pei Ning didn't even know if Qiao's mother was still at the apartment.

The rain was heavy, pouring down like water. Pei Ning lay on the sofa watching the rain in the courtyard. The roses in the yard were battered and broken, and her toes swayed slightly, like little tails.

Qiao Song cleared the dishes and came out, cutting up the cantaloupe and watermelon from the refrigerator. Pei Ning, seeing the raindrops falling heavily, turned around and smiled at her when she heard the noise. "Qiao Song, how about we watch a movie?"

Qiao Song, having nothing to do, agreed without hesitation.

The two settled on the sofa. Qiao Song chose a movie, but Pei Ning would stop her whenever she saw a cover she liked. After a while, they finally chose a comedy released a couple of years ago.

The story was about protecting the marine environment. Pei Ning tore open a bag of potato chips and ate them with relish while watching the movie. She reached for a cantaloupe, but Qiao Song slapped her hand. Pei Ning looked at her with a slightly aggrieved expression. Qiao Song glanced at her, "Just took it out of the fridge, eat it later."

Pei Ning pouted and moved closer to Qiao Song, staring at the TV screen next to her.

The movie sound seemed to drown out the rain. Pei Ning rested her head on Qiao Song's shoulder, and Qiao Song didn't push her away.

A little while later, Pei Ning quietly picked up a plate, poked at the watermelon with a toothpick, and secretly glanced at Qiao Song. Qiao Song pretended not to see her, and Pei Ning stuffed the watermelon into her mouth in one bite, then forked off a new piece.

A little icy, Pei Ning held the toothpaste in her mouth for two seconds before chewing and swallowing.

As she looked around, Pei Ning started to doze off again.

Perhaps she was too tired from the ancient city; she had slept quite a while last night, but her body still felt weak.

Pei Ning rested her head on her shoulder, half her body leaning against her chest.

Qiao Song gently embraced her, wanting to carry her to bed, when she suddenly noticed a phone with its screen lit up in the sofa cushions. Perhaps it had been silenced while she was sleeping; the phone kept beeping with incoming calls, but there was no sound.

Qiao Song reached for it, not managing to pull the phone out, but half of the phone was visible.

Qiao Song saw two large characters on her phone screen—

“Mommy”

Her finger paused.

Then she looked down at Pei Ning, who was already asleep.

Asleep, Pei Ning was no longer as noisy as before, as docile as a kitten.

Her rosy lips were slightly upturned, her cupid's bow full and round. Her unmade-up face was fair and delicate, her skin looking as if it could be pinched to release moisture.

This was the little princess the Pei family had painstakingly raised.

She had never suffered hardship, innocent, lively, and naive.

Before—

She had been deceived by Lu Jinxiao, hadn't she?

She prided herself on being clever, yet she had been completely fooled by Lu Jinxiao, let alone the innocent Pei Ning.

Qiao Song thought of the message her mother had sent her last night, and the news that had nearly caused a stir this morning.

A dark glint appeared in her eyes. She thought for a moment, then let the phone screen remain lit, without pressing the answer button.

-
Pei Ning slept until dark.

She was woken up by the cold.

She had fallen asleep on the sofa, covered with a small blanket. Perhaps because she had tossed and turned so much, most of the blanket had fallen to the floor, and the panda print on it was folded up.

Pei Ning rubbed her eyes and looked around for Qiao Song.

Qingtuan: "I left a long time ago, I was waiting for you to come find me."

Pei Ning was slightly surprised, "When did you leave? You didn't even tell me!"

Qingtuan: "You were sleeping so soundly, who could wake you? But Qiao Song seemed a bit down, I wonder if something's wrong."

Qingtuan: "Now everyone online is saying you two are dating, saying you're clinging to Qiao Song and won't let go."

Pei Ning: "..."

The netizens' description was quite accurate.

Pei Ning washed her face and sent Qiao Song a WeChat message, but Qiao Song didn't reply.

Pei Ning scrolled through Weibo and saw the post Qiao Song had liked.

It was a hand-drawn photo of the two of them. With the news making such a big fuss, Qiao Song couldn't possibly be unaware, but even so, he hadn't unliked it.

Pei Ning recalled Qiao Song's bright eyes as he watched her eat, now seemingly covered in frost.

Pei Ning: "What trouble has Qiao Song run into?"

Qing Tuan: "I don't know either, but her mother isn't someone to be trifled with. I couldn't find Qiao Song's location in Beijing, so she's probably not there."

Pei Ning understood.

No wonder Qiao Song hadn't replied to the WeChat message.

The rain outside had stopped. Pei Ning had originally planned to go out for hot pot with Qiao Song, but now that Qiao Song was nowhere to be found, she had to eat alone.

She changed into casual clothes, the T-shirt and jeans that Joseph usually wore, and grabbed an umbrella in case it rained again.

Green bamboo grew on both sides of the gate. She came out through a side door, her sneakers crunching on the fallen bamboo leaves.

Looking up, she saw a woman in a shirt and trousers standing outside.

The woman held a black umbrella, wore champagne-colored high heels, her hair was clipped up, and she wore gold-rimmed glasses. Her phoenix eyes bore a seven or eight-tenths resemblance to Joseph's, but the rest of her features were completely different.

Her shirt was made of a fabric that resembled gauze, with a bow tie at the collar, hanging neatly to her chest.

Qiao Song was generally gentle and aloof, but the woman before him was clearly serious and icy.

Like a cold, unapproachable machine.

Upon seeing Pei Ning, Mrs. Qiao raised her head, her smile forced and seemingly polite, yet her demeanor was aggressive. "Are you Miss Pei? I'm Qiao Song's mother. May we speak?"

As a highly educated woman, Mrs. Qiao possessed an air of refinement. Pei Ning paused slightly, but quickly recovered. "Hello, Auntie. Are you here to see Qiao Song? She's not here."

"I know she's not here."

Mrs. Qiao's expression was somewhat aloof, her tone carrying a hint of disdain. "Qiao Song went back to her hometown to see her grandmother. Your affair has caused quite a stir. Her grandmother..." "When my mother-in-law found out, she was furious and almost ruined her health, so I told her to go back and take care of her."

Pei Ning didn't speak. Qiao's mother, observing her expression, became somewhat impatient. "I came to see Miss Pei this time only as a mother to talk to you. Of course, you can refuse me, but I think, given your current relationship with Qiao Song, you have no reason to refuse my suggestion."

Pei Ning: "Why do I feel like she's difficult to get along with?"

Qing Tuan: "Don't doubt it, she really is difficult to get along with."

Pei Ning felt a little sorry for Qiao Song.

To grow up in such an environment and still pursue one's dreams—how much courage must that have taken?

Pei Ning's smile was superficial, her tone extremely light, "Okay."

Mother Qiao led her to an upscale café outside the villa complex.

The coffee here was expensive, and perhaps because it was lunchtime, there weren't many people drinking coffee. Mother Qiao found a corner seat and ordered a latte. Pei Ning, who didn't like coffee, ordered a chocolate cake and slowly ate it.

She ate very obediently, always treating food with a reverent, almost sacred air. Mrs. Qiao took out a stack of documents from her LV tote bag and got straight to the point, “Ms. Pei, you probably don’t know my child very well. Qiao Song has always been first in her grade, never second. Her father and I have set a goal for her: to become a top lawyer in the industry.”

Mrs. Qiao smiled slightly, a hint of pride in her expression. She adjusted her glasses. “Over the years, she’s won countless awards. She wants to be in the entertainment industry; we can’t stop her, and it’s proven that this industry…” "This isn't right for her. Miss Pei, you've been pampered since childhood and haven't experienced much hardship. You don't know how difficult it is for us to raise a child."

She looked at Pei Ning through the mirror, as if trying to read her thoughts. "We've advised her to leave the entertainment industry. For the past two years, we've always thought that she'd come back once she's endured enough hardship, but she's stubborn and unwilling to listen to us. Now that her affair with you has come to light, her reputation in the industry is ruined. Leaving now and disappearing from the public eye would still offer her a better future—"

Pei Ning paused in her cake-eating.

Her fingers holding the spoon twitched slightly, then she put down the golden spoon, looked up at Mrs. Qiao, as if looking at a monster.

Mrs. Qiao felt extremely uncomfortable under her gaze. Pei Ning asked abruptly, "So, did you ask Qiao Song?"

Mrs. Qiao was taken aback, not quite understanding what Pei Ning meant. Just as she was about to speak, Pei Ning narrowed her eyes at her, "You said that from childhood to adulthood, Qiao Song has always been number one. You've invested so much effort in raising her, you want her to become a top lawyer, so you... you've never even asked Qiao Song's own wishes?"

"I... we were all doing it for her own good. How could she know how treacherous this society is? She—" "How could she not know?"

Pei Ning's face was calm, but her tone was helpless. "She entered the entertainment industry all by herself, without asking you for help even once. She's doing very well on this path, and she has many fans—"

"That's all just talk!"

Mother Qiao scoffed. "Fans might like you today, but they might like someone else tomorrow. They're unpredictable! Besides, actors humbling themselves to please them—what's the difference between that and selling themselves!"

Pei Ning looked incredulous.
