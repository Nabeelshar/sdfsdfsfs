<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

Chapter 4

Several teams were working on different missions in different locations. The director arranged for Lu Jinxiao, Pei Ning, and Qiao Song to be in the same car.

Lu Jinxiao hadn't had much screen time before, so being with these two popular actors would be a way to boost his popularity, ensuring the director could meet his expectations for Lu Jinxiao's agency.

Seeing Qiao Song get into the back seat, Pei Ning, without waiting for Lu Jinxiao to approach, rushed forward and squeezed into the car, pressing herself tightly next to Qiao Song.

Finally, she gave Lu Jinxiao a highly provocative look outside the car.

Pei Ning's eyes were threatening: "Qiao Song is mine, don't even think about her!"

Lu Jinxiao: "..."

So touching. He pressed his agitated heart to his lips.

Sure enough, Pei Ning was a little tsundere; she was clearly seething with jealousy, yet she pretended to ignore him!

Lu Jinxiao gave her a deep look, then glanced at Qiao Song.

He thought Qiao Song would be jealous because she noticed their interaction, but to his surprise, Qiao Song kept her head turned to look out the window, not turning to look at him even once.

Lu Jinxiao was certain that Qiao Song was sulking because she wasn't sitting with him.

He silently got into the passenger seat, thinking that after filming was over today, he would definitely ask Qiao Song out to explain.

He wasn't used to texting; after all, he was in the prime of his career, and a single screenshot could ruin it.

He couldn't afford to lose.

Pei Ning was engrossed in a barbecue tutorial video on his tablet when Qiao Song heard the noise and turned to look.

The two of them huddled together, watching with great interest.

Qing Tuan: "Master, your quest progress bar is too slow! It's been so long, and you're only at two percent!"

A long gray progress bar stretched before Pei Ning, with only a tiny bit of green at the beginning.

Pei Ning: "...Am I already being used as a stumbling block?"

Blame it on Lu Jinxiao's persistent harassment!

He's always hanging around Qiao Song; how could Qiao Song not care!

She was indignant when Qiao Song suddenly spoke up, "I'll do the grilling later. Your wound hasn't healed yet, so don't do these chores for now."

She was referring to the bandage on Pei Ning's arm.

"No way!"

Pei Ning blurted out, meeting Qiao Song's questioning gaze. She quickly added, "Qiao Song, your hands are so beautiful. What if you get burned while grilling? Fairies can't do these kinds of chores!"

She grabbed Qiao Song's fingers, giving her a "Don't worry, I'll do it" look. "I won't let you work so hard!"

Lu Jinxiao, sitting in the passenger seat: "..."

Wait, why are these two rivals suddenly acting out a sisterly bond?

When had Pei Ning ever seen Qiao Song before? She always seemed like a lioness with her fur standing on end.

Lu Jinxiao chimed in, "Pei Ning's right, Qiao Song, your hands are indeed quite beautiful, not really suited for grilling."

He had expected Qiao Song to give him a grateful look, but instead, she just glanced at him indifferently. "My hands are indeed quite beautiful."

Then she added, "Looks like your hands are more suited for begging."

Comments: "Hahahaha, Qiao Song is really ruthless! The whole internet will be watching Lu Jinxiao beg for food soon!"

Comments: "Ennn, weren't Qiao Song and Lu Jinxiao supposed to be close?" "Why do they seem so distant?"

Comments: "Mind your own business with the pretty girl. Take Qiao Song away! She and the handsome guy are just business partners, they're not close!"

Pei Ning observed the atmosphere, chewing on a lollipop, and tilted her head to look at Qiao Song. Qiao Song was looking at her. "What's wrong? Have you decided how to sell it later?"

Pei Ning nodded blankly, moved closer to her, rested her chin on her shoulder, chewed on her lollipop, cupped her face in her small hands, and forcefully turned her face towards her.

Her breathing was soft, very close to Qiao Song. She whispered in his ear, "Qiao Song, don't look at him. He's a jerk. What if you like him more and more the more you look at him?"

Her voice was audible only to the two of them.

Qiao Song looked down at her, his mind racing.

Could Pei Ning before him also be a reincarnated soul?

Qiao Song's eyes flickered, but his ears burned from the close proximity.

Pei Ning still cupped her face in his hands, his round eyes looking at her with a coquettish tone, "Please?"

The chat was filled with comments: "Ahhh! Are these two doing this in broad daylight?! Is this the kind of thing we can do on a live stream?!"

The chat was filled with comments: "Screenshot! Screenshot! Quick, screenshot! These two are killing me!"

The chat was filled with comments: "At this moment, I feel just like Lu Jinxiao sitting in the front row, as steady as a rock, a giant solar-powered light bulb that doesn't need charging."

Qiao Song didn't answer, but wrinkled her nose slightly, "What flavor is your lollipop?"

The air was filled with the smell of fruit.

"Lychee flavor!"

Pei Ning patted her small crossbody bag. "I have plenty more, Qiao Song, do you want some?"

Qiao Song didn't like sweets, so she gently pushed her away, leaning against the window. "No."

Pei Ning snuggled up to her and hugged her arm, her eyes practically glued to her.

This time, Qiao Song didn't push her away.

Pei Ning: "As long as Qiao Song secretly glances at Lu Jinxiao, I'll interrupt! I refuse to believe I can't steal Qiao Song away!"

Comments: "Pei Ning's eyes are practically glued to him, and Qiao Song doesn't even do anything about it!"

Comments: "Why call him Qiao Song? Call him husband!!!"

Comments: "Hahaha, are there any other sisters here from Weibo's trending topics like me?"

Pei Ning: "..."

Qing Tuan projected all the comments onto her screen. She scratched her head, "I..." "You can still call Qiao Song 'husband'? Aren't we just good friends?"

Qing Tuan: "...It can also be seen as expressing a close relationship. Right now, your level of intimacy doesn't seem quite there yet."

Pei Ning was a little disappointed: "...Oh."

After a brief moment of disappointment, she looked determined, "One day, I'll achieve that kind of close relationship with Qiao Song where I can call him 'husband'!"

Qing Tuan: "...It's possible...but unnecessary."

Pei Ning ignored her.

The drive was an hour long, and Pei Ning spent the entire time eating candy and watching Qiao Song. Later, feeling a little carsick, she even slept for about ten minutes on Qiao Song's lap.

By the time they arrived in Dagu Town, it was already past ten in the morning.

Pei Ning and Qiao Song's barbecue stall was borrowed from a barbecue restaurant owner in the ancient town by the director.

It had rained last night, and the air in the ancient town was very fresh this morning. Pei Ning stared at the barbecue grill and ingredients in front of him, listening to the director say, "Later, you'll have to split half of the money you make with the owner as a tool fee for using the grill."

Pei Ning looked up at the director, "You have to pay for using the grill?"

The director chuckled, "Of course! You're using their stuff, so you have to pay. They can't let you use it for free, right?"

It wasn't a holiday, so there weren't many people in the ancient town. Pei Ning glanced around, rolled up his sleeves, and asked the owner for a large piece of cardboard and a ballpoint pen.

The director secretly gloated, "Hehehe, this young lady is probably participating in a variety show for the first time; she doesn't know the treacherous nature of people."

He reminded her from the side, "You can't sell overpriced barbecue just because you're celebrities! And you're not allowed to sell it with autographs!"

Pei Ning glanced at him, puzzled, and continued writing.

Only Qiao Song quietly watched her write. As she neared completion, Qiao Song couldn't help but chuckle.

Comments: "I laughed! The ice queen actually laughed! So what did the young lady write?"

Comments: "Director's got guts! He really dared to let this young lady sell barbecue herself?"

Comments: "Hey, 'young lady' is a derogatory term, stop spamming it!"

However, the comments flashed by quickly, drowned out by the flood of comments. Pei Ning had already written on the paper.

She held up the enormous paper, her eyes sparkling, a sweet smile on her face.

The director, seeing the words on the paper, paused in his drinking motion, almost spitting out his water.

The sign read: BBQ Experience Event, NT$300 per person/hour, all BBQ food is free!

Pei Ning placed the sign next to the grill and borrowed the owner's megaphone to shout, "Free BBQ! Free BBQ! All-you-can-eat for one hour! Don't miss it!"

Josong was amused by this and readily cooperated with Pei Ning's efforts to attract customers. Many tourists nearby found the sign interesting, and given Josong's good reputation, they also wanted to try it out.

Josong divided the time slots into several periods; customers simply came to grill according to their chosen time. Since there was only one grill, and a deposit was required, there was no worry about customers not showing up.

"Leave your phone number here; if they don't show up on time, we'll call to remind them."

In just a short while, the shop received three groups of pre-booked customers.

The first group was a couple. The girl really liked Qiao Song and even asked Pei Ning to take a photo of them together.

The girl's boyfriend started grilling, using the food the girl liked.

Pei Ning's job was simply to serve them drinks and offer verbal guidance.

The owner of the barbecue shop stood inside, arms crossed, looking utterly bewildered.

"You can make money like this???"

Soon, an hour passed. The young couple left happily. Pei Ning received 600 yuan, gave Qiao Song a cheerful hug, and waited for the second wave of pre-booked customers.

The director said, "Qin Chen and Nie Suisui have already earned over 1000 yuan performing. Your group needs to hurry up, or you'll be last."

Pei Ning, who had barely received the money, was speechless.

Tearfully, she shared half with the boss and anxiously awaited the second wave of customers.

But something seemed amiss with the second wave. Qiao Song called, but the other party didn't answer.

Although she had paid a deposit, it was only 100 yuan.

Now she only had 400 yuan, far less than the others' 1000+ yuan.

Pei Ning felt even more dejected thinking about the crystal bracelet.

The director said, "Now, I'm going to give you a challenge. Whoever completes this challenge will receive a reward of 500 yuan from the production team. Are you willing to complete the task?"

Pei Ning's eyes lit up. "I'll do it!"

Qiao Song grabbed her hand. "You don't even know what the challenge is, why are you raising your hand?"

Qiao Song sometimes thought this girl was a bit too naive.

Pei Ning glared at her angrily. "I can't let that crystal bracelet fall into someone else's hands. I said I'd win it and give it to you!"

Qiao Song was stunned. Pei Ning looked like she was ready to die for her cause. "I'm not afraid of any challenge!"

She was a fish that had been leaping over the Dragon Gate for two thousand years!

I'm not afraid of difficulties!

The director was a little nervous, but still waved to his assistant.

When the assistant brought over a plate of bright red chili peppers still glistening with water droplets, Qiao Song's face turned pale. "We're not taking this challenge, Pei Ning. I don't like that bracelet. I don't want it anymore."
