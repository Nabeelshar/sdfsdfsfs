Chapter 18

Compared to other couples, Pei Ning and Qiao Song's trip to Haicheng seemed much more upscale.

It's said that Nie Suisui and Qin Chen's travel destination was in the countryside near Beijing, and their task was—

herding cattle.

This shows that the director was quite lenient with them.

Some netizens complained that Qiao Song and Pei Ning were being treated too well, and someone immediately countered.

Comments:

"Stop joking, coming to Haicheng? We risked our lives for it."

"Hahaha, I thought the director would at least arrange an overseas trip or something, but it's just two days in Haicheng. You're such a cheapskate!"

"As expected, the cheapskate director lives up to his name. I just hope this time he doesn't waste all his intelligence making things difficult for us two girls like last time."

The comments were full of agreement.

There wasn't much CP (couple) content distributed, so CP fans basically had to find their own. Last week, it was revealed that the two stayed together, but neither of their agencies responded.

No response is tantamount to tacit admission.

CP fans are silently dancing wildly in the supertopic.

Previously, Ke Song had always disliked Pei Ning and their CP fans, but ever since Qiao Song liked her post without canceling or explaining, the fans have become quite perceptive.

With this "whatever" attitude, would the fans believe she has no connection with Pei Ning, or would she herself believe it?

On Friday afternoon, the two were scheduled to go to the beach to watch the sunset.

Haicheng's weather is already very humid and hot, and with the summer temperatures soaring, anyone standing outside in the blazing sun without getting heatstroke is practically an iron man.

Pei Ning and Qiao Song were well-prepared for the sun. Before setting off, they applied sunscreen to each other, wore large sun hats, and even their dresses were similar in style, one white and the other red.

The two women had completely different styles. Pei Ning was lively and enthusiastic, while Qiao Song, in her white dress, possessed a more aloof and stunning beauty than usual, creating a sense of distance, yet without appearing monotonous or dull.

The director assigned them a hidden mission—

to collect seashells on the beach. Among the thousands of seashells, one was different. Finding that seashell would bring a special surprise—

a themed restaurant specially booked for them by the production team.

Finding that seashell was equivalent to obtaining admission to the themed restaurant.

The director coaxed her, "The themed restaurant is in the sea. You'll sit in a glass room and see whales swimming overhead. If you get tired of eating, you can even sit there and get a massage or something."

Pei Ning thought to herself, what hasn't she seen? Fish, surely!

She herself was a carp spirit; was the director trying to send her back to her happy childhood?

Pei Ning wasn't really interested in this ocean-themed restaurant. Finding seashells or not made no difference, and besides—

She didn't want Qiao Song to be so tired.

After listening to the director's explanation and glancing at the photos of the themed restaurant, Qiao Song turned to Pei Ning and asked, "Do you want to go?"

Pei Ning opened her mouth, wanting to say she didn't really want to go, but Qiao Song seemed to have misunderstood and patted her shoulder, "Don't worry, I'll definitely get that seashell back for you."

Pei Ning: "?"

There's really no need.

She really didn't have any interest in those things!

Comments: "Ahhh! So sweet! You want it, I'll give it to you! Even the highest form of love can't surpass this!"

Comments: "Josong is so doting! Ningning is so lucky!!!"

Comments: "I came over from watching the two couples next door; those two cowherd couples are making me feel like I'm back in the 70s."

The comments section is filled with laughter.

Pei Ning: "Sweet? What's so sweet about it? Why don't I think it's sweet?"

Qing Tuan: "CP fans are so into it that they think it's sweet just seeing you two standing together. When you and Qiao Song make eye contact, they've already thought of names for your child."

Pei Ning: "Our child's surname will be Qiao. I think the surname Qiao is pretty good."

Qing Tuan: "???"

Qing Tuan: "Are you kidding me?"

Qing Tuan: "Why are you shipping yourselves? Look at your progress bar!!! It's only 60%!! If it doesn't increase soon, you're finished!!!"

Pei Ning: "..."

Feeling a tiny bit of an existential crisis.

Pei Ning sighed helplessly, "Based on my interactions with Qiao Song lately, she hasn't had any contact with Lu Jinxiao. There's an 80% chance she won't be with him again. But even after all this, progress is still so slow. Why is that?"

Pei Ning followed Qiao Song slowly.

The sun hadn't yet set, and the 5 PM sun was already making one's head spin.

Pei Ning watched Qiao Song bent over, carefully searching through the damp sand beneath her feet.

Her expression was devout, as if she were searching for a long-lost treasure.

The blinding sunlight streamed in from the beach, scorching her back. Pei Ning thought, "Such intense sunlight all afternoon would probably hurt me."

She squinted, suddenly remembering the embrace she and Qiao Song had shared under the streetlights along the shady path after seeing Qiao's mother.

At that time, Qiao Song was relaxed.

His previous guard was gone.

She felt a sense of security, a surge of—

confidence?

Yes, that's right, confidence.

Pei Ning's eyes suddenly welled up with tears. She clenched her fists tightly, her fingertips digging into her palms, a little uncomfortable.

Pei Ning: "So, saving Qiao Song had nothing to do with any man she was with from the very beginning."

Pei Ning: "The reason we had to pull her out of hell was because she had never met anyone in her entire life who made her want to stay in the human world."

Pei Ning: "I understand."

Qing Tuan: "?"

Qing Tuan: "Master, why do I feel like you've suddenly had a breakthrough, like you've unlocked your full potential?"

Pei Ning felt a tightness in her chest. "I just feel like I realized it too late. The reason Qiao Song cared about Lu Jinxiao wasn't because she loved him."

She paused. "She just wanted a reason to stay in the human world."

Those kinds of parents, that oppressive living environment, those suppressed dreams.

Each one of them would be enough to crush a person.

And of course, the extremely sensitive Josong was.

In the distance, the sea and sky met at the horizon. The sun slowly sank behind the hillside; before sunset, the bright, white sunlight was blinding.

Pei Ning blinked, her eyes red. Just then, Josong picked up a seashell, turned around, and smiled at her, "Found it!"

In the backlight, her smile was momentarily blurred by the sunlight, then gradually became clear and bright.

Pei Ning smiled too.

A genuine, heartfelt smile, like a return gesture, like a confession.

Yes, you found it.

—I found it too.

—I can finally save you.

-

Pei Ning looked at the seashells Qiao Song had collected and couldn't help but complain to the director, "Wasn't it supposed to be unique and distinctive, so obvious that you could tell it was different at a glance?"

What's the difference between these brightly colored, dyed seashells and those cheap, dyed turtles you could buy for five cents in elementary school?!

Director: "Hehehe, you guys still managed to find them."

Pei Ning rolled her eyes.

Qiao Song spent the whole afternoon sunning them to find them!

If the props department had been even slightly more reliable, Qiao Song wouldn't have had to endure being sunned for so long!

Then she saw Qiao Song had collected a bag full of beautifully patterned seashells.

Pei Ning casually picked one up to look at it. Qiao Song smiled faintly, "I thought they were pretty, so I picked them all up."

Pei Ning wanted to say, what's so pretty about them? Back when she was a carp, these scallop spirits chased after her every day; she was tired of seeing them.

However, Qiao Song had picked them up.

Pei Ning nodded emphatically, her eyes sparkling, "So pretty! I love them! Thank you, Qiao Song!"

Qiao Song: "They're not for you."

Pei Ning: "?"

Qiao Song: "I picked them up to put in the fish tank."

Pei Ning: "..."

Qiao Song was doomed.

After collecting the seashells, Pei Ning and Qiao Song prepared to head to the themed hotel, just as the sunset truly arrived.

The entire sea was bathed in the glow of the sunset, the colors gradually shifting from red to orange as they spread across the horizon. The sun slowly descended, hiding behind the clouds, then emerging again.

Pei Ning stood beside Qiao Song, watching the sunset together.

The waves rolled in, and the two of them became silhouettes against the sunset-lit sea.

Josong suddenly whispered, "I was just kidding you."

Pei Ning: "?"

Josong: "I just picked it up for you."

Pei Ning squinted at the sunset, grabbed her arm, pressed her cheek against her shoulder, and whispered back, "Actually, I know."

Their conversation was only audible to each other.

Josong raised an eyebrow, adjusted her hat brim, and then heard Pei Ning laugh in her ear, "Because Josong loves me the most. She wouldn't give any of your good things to anyone else."

There was no fish tank.

It was only her from beginning to end.

Josong didn't say anything, just let her hold her arm, tilted her head back to look at the sunset, and her smile grew even wider.

Comments: "If these two don't actually get together, I'll swallow a thousand nails!!!"

Comments: "Ahhhhh, I can't believe I've ever seen such a beautiful love story in my lifetime?!"

Comments: "Joseon smiled. As a devoted fan of Joseon for years, I don't think I've ever seen him smile so happily..."

The "delivery couple" trended on social media.

Nie Suisui and Qin Chen also trended because they fell into a mud puddle while herding cattle.

However, everyone was criticizing their lack of chemistry.

Qin Chen's fans were especially furious, creating accounts to bombard Nie Suisui's comments.

In their eyes, Nie Suisui was a hypocrite, a useless person who only dragged their idol down.

Pei Ning felt a pang of pity; after all, they had done two live streams together, and she knew Nie Suisui.

That lovely girl, because of Qin Chen, had even abandoned all pretense of dignity—she must have liked him a little, right?

Even if it was just for show.

But fans are never easy to control. This outburst earned Nie Suisui the nickname "White Lotus Sister" in the industry. From then on, Nie Suisui never participated in any variety shows again, focusing instead on honing her acting skills, eventually winning a Best Actress award.

On the other hand, Qin Chen...

When his co-star was scolded and splashed with dirty water, he didn't offer a single explanation. He was afraid to offend the fans, which led to fewer and fewer young actresses wanting to work with him. Later, his opportunities dwindled, his career declined significantly, and eventually, he disappeared from the entertainment industry.

Of course, that's a story for later.

Pei Ning went to a trendy themed restaurant, only to find out that a night there would cost over ten thousand yuan per person.

And the director hadn't arranged for them a private room with a view of marine life, but rather the main ocean-themed hall.

A private room cost two hundred thousand yuan a night.

It's obvious the director was reluctant to spend that much.

Pei Ning felt a little sorry that Qiao Song had spent the entire afternoon bent over in the sun.

She was already exhausted, and to make matters worse, the product wasn't what she expected. Of course, she wasn't happy.

So she contacted Aunt Zhang to get the hotel to change their dining location to a private room.

Upon entering the private room, Pei Ning looked around but didn't see Qiao Song. Just as she was about to call her, the door opened.

Qiao Song was wearing a little black dress, her wavy hair cascading behind her ears, and she held a bouquet of vibrant red roses in her arms.
