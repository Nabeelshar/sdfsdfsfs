Chapter 2

Qiao Song: "..."

I must say, this woman has a real knack for acting.

Pei Ning and Qiao Song's pairing is generating more buzz than the other three couples on the show.

The director, watching the online trending topics explode, grinned from ear to ear, as if he could hear money raining down in his ears.

Back at the hotel, Pei Ning had to complete the initial impression assessment for the date. She gave Qiao Song a score of 99 on the whiteboard. When she held up the whiteboard for him to see, Qiao Song was visibly surprised. The director beside her asked, "Why 99, not 100?"

Qing Tuan: "Yeah, Master, why not just give it 100?"

Pei Ning smugly hummed, "You don't know this, giving 100 seems a bit perfunctory, like I didn't take it seriously. Giving 99 makes me seem meticulous and proves I thought it through."

Qing Tuan: "...Really?"

Pei Ning looked at Qiao Song thoughtfully. She smiled sweetly, "Because netizens all say that Qiao Song is a perfect idol, flawless. I give Qiao Song 99 points because I think she doesn't always have to be perfect, at least not in front of me."

Qing Tuan: "...That's quite a convincing story, Master, your tongue is quite eloquent..."

Pei Ning: "...If you listened to crosstalk every day when you were trying to leap over the dragon gate, your eloquence wouldn't be bad either."

A hint of surprise flashed in Qiao Song's eyes, but she quickly regained her composure. She was increasingly confused about what this woman was playing at.

Was she trying to create the illusion that they had a good relationship, so she could have more say when it came to vying for a man?

This was completely different from her previous life.

Qiao Song smiled, but her heart was filled with coldness.

She would never be like she was in her previous life, giving up her life for a scumbag.

Her fingers gripped the whiteboard marker tightly, suppressing her emotions. After taking a deep breath, she smiled faintly, "Thank you."

Her smile was gentle and pure, like a spring breeze, striking straight to the heart.

Pei Ning: "See, I told you she'd like him!"

Qiao Song set up the whiteboard she had already written on, "My score is about the same as Xiao Ning's."

A large 100 was clearly drawn on the whiteboard.

Pei Ning covered her mouth in surprise, "Qiao Song, so I'm that perfect in your heart!"

Qing Tuan complained, "You can tell she wasn't serious about the score! She just ticked a hundred, she's just trying to fool you, Master!"

Pei Ning resisted the urge to roll her eyes, "How could that be! It must be because my goodwill this afternoon worked! Qiao Song wouldn't lie to me! She even bought me ice cream to wipe my mouth this afternoon!"

Qing Tuan: "?" Pei Ning clutched her chest, her face beaming. "Qiao Song is so kind! He's so good-hearted, afraid of hurting my feelings, he didn't even want to give me a lower score."

Qing Tuan: "???"

Pei Ning stood up, her expression shy. Qiao Song's eyes remained calm, wanting to see how she would continue her act. His tone was gentle. "That's right, Xiao Ning, you're very cute, worth a hundred points."

"Thank you, Qiao Song!"

Pei Ning was very satisfied.

Qiao Song giving her a hundred points meant her rescue plan, which she had just begun, was very successful.

She had entered Qiao Song's heart effortlessly!

The couple's live stream ended after the score was given.

The other three teams also quickly finished their dates. As soon as the cameras were turned off, Josong reverted to her icy beauty nature, grabbed her phone, and headed towards her hotel room.

Qingtuan: "Master, the mission has a time limit. If you don't complete it soon, you won't be able to redeem the equipment, and you'll be a little bald dragon forever!"

Pei Ning: "..."

Her heart, which had just settled, jumped again.

She took a breath and called out to Josong, who was about to leave, "Josong!"

The surrounding staff didn't notice the commotion.

Qiao Song paused, turning her head to see her. A flash of disdain crossed her eyes, but her tone remained as gentle as before, "Is there anything else?"

Pei Ning, oblivious to the change, smiled sweetly, seemingly without a trace of suspicion, "Let's have dinner together later!"

Qiao Song initially wanted to say it wasn't necessary, but after calming down, she glanced at Pei Ning.

This woman was acting very strangely today. Wasn't putting on an act in front of so many people enough?

Presumably, she wasn't being invited to dinner, but rather a grand banquet?

Qiao Song, accustomed to striking first, was exceptionally patient. She raised a slight brow and smiled faintly, "Alright."

Pei Ning left, satisfied. Qiao Song clenched her fists, a cold smile playing on her lips.

So soon, the fox's tail couldn't be hidden anymore?

...
At eight o'clock in the evening, Pei Ning finished showering and carefully dressed herself before arriving at the rooftop restaurant.

She and Qiao Song had arranged to meet at 8:30.

Restaurant reservations were required for the rooftop restaurant. Since the hotel belonged to the Pei family, she had priority. Upon reaching the rooftop, she saw a man in a black suit, his hair impeccably combed.

Hearing the commotion, Lu Jinxiao slowly turned around. The "handsome young man" title wasn't for nothing; his looks easily surpassed many of today's young heartthrobs.

Seeing Pei Ning enter, he flashed a broad smile. Just as he walked towards her, Pei Ning took off her suit jacket, draped it over her arm, and extended it towards him.

Pei Ning: "I didn't expect even the waiters in the human world to be so handsome!"

Qing Tuan: "...Master, he's the male lead, Lu Jinxiao!"

Pei Ning paused, her hand poised to throw the suit jacket, then withdrew it. She smacked Lu Jinxiao from head to toe, mercilessly criticizing: "Greasy, old-fashioned, shifty eyes, frivolous!"

Still not satisfied, she added: "Scumbag!"

Unexpectedly, these words slipped out of her mouth. Lu Jinxiao's handsome face showed a moment of surprise, then filled with deep apology, "Ningning, I'm sorry, I didn't know you'd be on this show. You've misunderstood me..."

Pei Ning lifted her eyelids, crossed her arms, and looked at him with an expression that said, "Keep making things up."

Qingtuan jumped up and down anxiously, "Master, you need to let Qiao Song know Lu Jinxiao's true colors! We can't openly confront Lu Jinxiao yet! We can't let him see through our disguise!"

Pei Ning: "...Acting is so hard."

She just wanted to be a bald little dragon who clearly distinguished between love and hate.

However, Qing Tuan's reminder immediately made Pei Ning look dejected. Seeing this, Lu Jinxiao's expression also became more serious. "Ningning, I've always known your feelings, but right now I only have my career on my mind; I don't want to talk about relationships—"

"What about Qiao Song?"

Pei Ning looked up at him, her tone becoming more serious. "Do you like Qiao Song?"

"How could I possibly like her!"

Lu Jinxiao blurted out almost instinctively, then hesitated, slowly explaining, "We only worked together on a movie; there's nothing between us!"

Pei Ning sneered inwardly. According to the original plot, Lu Jinxiao and Qiao Song were indeed not yet together.

After the variety show recording, Lu Jinxiao proposed to Qiao Song that she become his secret lover.

Qiao Song came from a terrible family background and initially thought that meeting Lu Jinxiao was like finding her only light.

However, this light led her down a path to death.

After being with Qiao Song, Lu Jinxiao became restless and frequently created a romantic pairing with the original owner of the body for publicity. Qiao Song would protest each time, but Lu Jinxiao would instead accuse her of being immature and saying she didn't understand his hardships.

As a result, Qiao Song's mental state deteriorated day by day.

If it weren't for the long-term control and suppression by Lu Jinxiao, the gentle and bright Qiao Song wouldn't have chosen to jump off the overpass.

Pei Ning clenched her fingers, feigning indifference, and innocently smiled, "If you had to choose between me and Qiao Song, would you choose me or Qiao Song?"

"Of course, it's you!"

Lu Jinxiao stepped forward, wanting to hold Pei Ning's hand, but Pei Ning naturally avoided it.

Lu Jinxiao said urgently, "Ningning, I know you like me, and I like you too. After this variety show recording is over, I'll take you on a trip. Tomorrow, can you go back first and not continue filming?"

Qingtuan: "Master, Qiao Song is only thirty meters away from you! She's on the stairs!"

This meant that Qiao Song saw her standing with Lu Jinxiao.

Pei Ning smiled faintly, replying very perfunctorily, "Okay."

Lu Jinxiao's eyebrows lit up with joy. Pei Ning glanced around, "It's getting late. You have filming tomorrow, go back to sleep."

Lu Jinxiao was touched, feeling that Pei Ning was too considerate and understanding.

He went downstairs, turning back every three steps. After everyone left, Qing Tuan wilted, "Master, Qiao Song is gone! She definitely thinks you called her here to deliberately watch you and Lu Jinxiao on a date! She probably thinks you're provoking her!"

Pei Ning pouted, "I wouldn't even bother looking at a scumbag like Lu Jinxiao!"

Doesn't that fit her aesthetic standards?!

Pei Ning, in her high heels, hurried down to catch up with Qiao Song.

She clutched her phone, recording every word she'd just said to Lu Jinxiao.

She didn't think Qiao Song was unreasonable.

Playing the recording to Qiao Song might help him understand Lu Jinxiao's true nature.

With Qingtuan's live GPS navigation, Pei Ning quickly found Qiao Song in the garden. Qiao Song was sitting on the swing under the rose trellis, drinking a bottle of beer.

Pei Ning: "Looks delicious."

Although the bald-headed Pei Ning knew the plot of the book, she hadn't retained the original owner's memories; in other words, she didn't know what food tasted like.

Qingtuan: "Master, business is more important!"

Pei Ning rolled her eyes, straightened her appearance, forced a smile, and walked towards Qiao Song. "Qiao Song!"

Qiao Song, who had been swinging on the swing, turned her head at the sound of her voice, her eyes filled with undisguised disgust.

Qiao Song wasn't going to pay attention to Pei Ning when suddenly, the swing swayed, its arc widening considerably.

Qiao Song, holding a beer in one hand, didn't have time to steady herself before hearing Pei Ning's soft exclamation: "Watch out!"

The next second, Qiao Song was thrown off the swing.

Oh no.

Qiao Song closed her eyes, thinking she was definitely going to fall.

Before her body even touched the ground, she was embraced by a warm, soft embrace. Almost instantly, Pei Ning was firmly pinned beneath her, enduring the powerful impact.

"It hurts!"

Pei Ning wrapped her arms around Qiao Song's waist, letting out a muffled groan, her soft, adorable voice tinged with a sob.

Qiao Song finally came to her senses. She had only taken a couple of sips of wine and wasn't drunk. She rolled over and knelt beside her, checking on Pei Ning. "Are you alright?"

Even though she didn't like her, at this moment, Qiao Song's tone was filled with concern.

Pei Ning's arm was scraped and bleeding from debris, but this little bald dragon had a self-healing ability; she'd be fine in a bit.

Pei Ning, her eyes brimming with tears, crossed her arms and looked weakly at Qiao Song, "Qiao Song, are you hurt?"

Qiao Song was speechless. What kind of time was this to be concerned about someone else? She really couldn't understand what this woman was playing at.

Was that a self-inflicted injury ploy?

She said coldly, "I'm fine. I'll take you to get your wound treated."

As an artist, she naturally knew how important it was to protect her appearance.

"Qiao Song, I'm fine..."

Pei Ning grabbed her sleeve, looking at her with teary eyes, "Lu Jinxiao is a bad man. Don't be with him. Don't like him anymore, okay?"

Qiao Song's face turned cold, and she was about to say something.

Pei Ning pressed the record button on her phone. A clear conversation came from inside.

"Do you like Josong?"

—"How could I possibly like her!"

"Then, if you had to choose between me and Josong, would you want me or Josong?"

—"Of course, you!"

The garden fell silent for a moment.

Pei Ning's eyes were red-rimmed. "Josong, stay away from bad men like that. He'll hurt you."

Her small, soft hands gripped Josong's slender fingers. "Josong, you absolutely, absolutely deserve to be treated well..."
