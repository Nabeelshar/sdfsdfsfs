Chapter 5

"Why?"

Pei Ning looked at her with reddened eyes, "I want to give you the best. I won't give you anything that isn't the best."

She was already soft and cute, but now her face was tense, and she looked like she was about to cry, which made Qiao Song fall silent for a moment.

“Anything you give me is the best.”

Josong stopped her, took a chili pepper from the plate, and said, “I’ll take it.”

Comments: “Aaaaah! Josong can’t eat spicy food! Is the production team trying to kill us by giving us a chili pepper?!”

Comments: “Young lady wants to win first place herself, don’t drag our Josong down with you! What a pretentious show-off!”

Comments: “Those who said Pei Ning was pretentious, she said she just wanted to give Josong the best, okay?!”

The comments kept flooding in. Pei Ning panicked when she heard Josong couldn’t eat spicy food. Seeing Josong holding the chili pepper, about to put it in his mouth, she stood on tiptoe, grabbed Josong’s wrist, bit the chili pepper, chewed it haphazardly, and swallowed it.

Soft lips were still touching her fingers.

Josong's fingers were a little cold; Pei Ning almost bit them.

The spiciness of the chili pepper started the moment it entered her mouth.

The spiciness felt like a fire burning in her mouth, both painful and intense, quickly spreading to her esophagus and stomach.

Pei Ning felt nauseous from the spiciness and, after a few bites, turned and leaned against the trash can.

Josong quickly grabbed a drink for her, unwrapped it, and held it to her lips. Seeing the photographer still trying to capture her embarrassed expression from the spiciness, Josong frowned and said firmly, "Stop taking pictures!"

She rarely showed a cold face in public, and the photographer wisely took a few steps back, ceasing to shoot her face directly.

Comments: "Qiao Song actually got angry! He's really protecting his wife! My ship is real!!!"

Comments: "Don't mention Qiao Song! It's clearly Pei Ning who's being unreasonable and causing trouble! Moral blackmail doesn't work here, thank you!"

Comments: "Hey you, nobody's forcing your idol to bring you water or wipe your mouth. It's a romance variety show, your idol has already agreed to the CP pairing, and you're not allowing people to ship them?"

This comment was followed by countless "+1"s.

Comments "Seriously?! Someone's here watching a romance variety show and they're actually criticizing the couple? Do they really think the main characters are being forced into this pairing?"

"To be fair, the young lady herself is good for nothing but hype. It's normal that fans don't want to get involved."

"Shut up, all of you! I don't care! My favorite couple is the best!"

Pei Ning watched these people arguing and understood that they thought she wasn't worthy of being friends with Qiao Song.

Hmph, she didn't care!

She was going to be friends with Qiao Song!

Qiao Song grabbed a tissue, intending to wipe Pei Ning's face, but Pei Ning grabbed her hand, pulled the tissue away, and wiped herself haphazardly.

She tidied herself up for a while, then downed most of a bottle of soda before slowly turning around. Looking up at Qiao Song, she smiled again, tears still clinging to her eyelashes. Pretending nothing was wrong, she said, "I'm fine, this little bit of spice is nothing!"

She patted her chest, quite proudly, "If we attract more customers later, we'll definitely be number one!"

Qing Tuan: "..."

This damned competitive spirit.

Qing Tuan: "Master, if you were still a carp spirit, I'd definitely make you stuff more ginger and scallion slices into your steamer today, along with some bird's eye chili slices. Otherwise, you won't know what it means to be reckless."

Eating bird's eye chilies is way too dangerous for her!

Pei Ning: "...Don't make a fuss, it's not going to kill me."

Qing Tuan: "Although, besides external injuries, your internal organs don't have self-healing capabilities. If you eat something that causes illness, and if you encounter a system bug, it's not impossible for your soul to perish. If you don't want to complete the mission and want to be a little bald dragon forever, then pretend I didn't say anything."

Pei Ning: "...A low-probability event, and besides, being a little bald dragon isn't so bad."

Qing Tuan hysterically: "You're still being stubborn!!!"

Pei Ning: "..."

She obediently shrank back, not daring to speak again, but her stomach was indeed upset.

"Where do you feel unwell? I'll take you to the hospital."

Josong helped her to the side to rest. Pei Ning shook her head, looking at her with unwavering determination, "I'm really fine, I can even jump around a bit for you."

After saying that, she hopped around twice, the bunny ears on her headband trembling and almost slipping off.

Josong glanced at her silently, straightened her headband, and fixed her bunny ears. "Don't jump, rest for a while."

She turned around and went to attract customers.

Since Pei Ning wanted that crystal bracelet so much,

she would go and win it.

Just then, the second group of customers arrived—a large family, three generations. Excluding the elderly and children, Pei Ning only charged five people. She greeted them, helped them find seats, and busied herself with various tasks.

Considering the elderly's teeth and health, she prepared foil-wrapped vermicelli and eggplant, keeping the food light.

For the children, she arranged sausages. Since she didn't need to grill them herself, and seeing that the family also had a toddler, she asked the owner for a high chair so the mother could rest and the child wouldn't have to sit in the stroller looking around.

Comments: "I guess it's because I love her that I love her too. Now I find Pei Ning pleasing to the eye."

Comments: "To be honest, besides her spoiled brat temper, her love of showing off her wealth, her lack of common sense, her disregard for resources, and her tendency to offend people, Pei Ning doesn't have any major flaws."

Comments: "Is the person above being sarcastic??? She's got all these flaws and you still say she doesn't have any? Why don't you go be her foot-washing maid?"

Another barrage of comments ensued.

Pei Ning: "These young people these days are so hot-tempered! Back in my hometown, thousands of fish gather here every day, and I've never seen anyone fight over a front-row seat."

Qing Tuan: "..."

Have you noticed? Doesn't this person realize these people are all insulting her?

The second group of guests were very cheerful and talkative, even playing a song-guessing game with them.

If it weren't for Qing Tuan, Pei Ning would have lost the game miserably.

After all, she didn't know many songs.

Qing Tuan was still angry because of her arguing, and after the game ended, she ignored her completely. An hour passed quickly, and this group even took a group photo with them before leaving.

Half of the 1500 yuan had to be shared, but adding what they had earned before and the rewards from the show's challenges, they now had 1550 yuan.

Pei Ning put all the money she had earned in Qiao Song's apron pocket for him to keep.

She didn't know if it was because the food was too spicy, or if it was just Pei Ning's first time eating it and she wasn't used to it.

After seeing the guests off, Pei Ning's face was visibly pale.

"You look so pale, don't you really need to go to the hospital?"

Qiao Song glanced at the time; the third group of guests was about to arrive.

If Pei Ning showed any unusual symptoms, she would exit the game and take her to the hospital.

Pei Ning's stomach was hurting.

While playing with the customers, her attention had wandered, so she hadn't paid much attention, but now that she had stopped, the pain was indeed severe.

"Pei Ning?"

Qiao Song brushed her fingers against her forehead, bending down slightly to check on her. Pei Ning's forehead was covered in a cold sweat. She blocked Qiao Song's hand, "I'm fine, the spiciness will pass in a bit. I eat chili peppers all the time, really!"

Qiao Song was momentarily dazed.

She seemed to see a hint of grievance in this woman's eyes?

At 6 PM, the money-making task ended.

And the trending topics on Weibo had exploded.

#PeiNingQiaoSongSoSweet

#PeiNingEatsChiliPeppers

#PeiNingSellsBBQ

Unsuspecting passersby clicked in and saw a large number of fans criticizing her.

Qiaoqiao is mine: "This lady has no shame when it comes to fame. All that resources and she hasn't even made a ripple. Does she really think everyone's her servant? Does it feel good to climb over my sister to get ahead?"

Singing for you: "When I was watching the live stream today, I had a feeling it would trend. Sure enough, this young lady has a firm grasp of the secrets to wealth. Eating a chili pepper and she's moved heaven and earth. I didn't see you guys worrying about 4 AM..." The street sweeper was moved to tears.

Josong's wife: "The show's script made me just a tool. I came here to participate in a dating variety show, but is the show team feeding us shit?! Who are they trying to disgust with this rich girl??? @JosongStudio, please use your brains when you accept variety show offers!!!"

While she was criticizing, a clip of Josong and Pei Ning's live stream went viral.

In the video, Josong wiped Pei Ning's mouth, the two gave each other scores, looked at each other, hugged, and held hands.

Fox Not Stupid: "Seriously, isn't their sweetness better than the two couples next door? The main characters are getting along so well, why are the fans so overreacting?"

Sui Yi: "The CP is so sweet! They already have a supertopic, sisters, go for it! (Fans, don't come in here and complain. Go try dancing in front of your main characters and see how they react.)"

Orange Peel: "Hahaha, this is the first time I've seen CP fans so blatantly aggressive. Even casual viewers think they're so sweet, these two are such a good match!"

Qiao Song Fans: "..."

Furious.

Don't these CP fans have any sense of propriety?!

What does Pei Ning have that's good enough for Qiao Song?!

Pei Ning entered the entertainment industry relying on her family's wealth, and after several years in the business, she's mostly known through hype and self-promotion.

Her acting is terrible, her singing is off-key, and she practically coasted through the talent show—her public image is awful!

Compare that to Qiao Song—

He's passionate about acting and hardworking. His only rumored relationship was with Lu Jinxiao during movie promotions, which was completely unfounded!

Because of his entry into the entertainment industry, Qiao Song still has a strained relationship with his family.

Such a talented and hardworking person is paired with a good-for-nothing rich girl on a dating show!

Absurd and ridiculous!

The online arguments raged, clearly showing a hierarchy.

Pei Ning's Weibo posts were usually just about outfits and accessories. After the hashtag went viral, her Weibo was quickly flooded with criticism.

She didn't have many followers to begin with.

Her comments were usually propped up by paid trolls.

Now her Weibo was bustling, but mostly with insults.

Her company manager was worried.

They were afraid that this young lady would throw a tantrum if she found out.

On the way back, Pei Ning still felt unwell, her body limp as she leaned on Qiao Song's shoulder.

The comments ranged from praising her sweetness to accusing her of scheming to curry favor with Qiao Song.

Lu Jinxiao was assigned to share a car with the director. He hadn't earned much money begging today and looked rather pathetic.

He didn't want these two women to see him.

"Qiao Song..."

Pei Ning's voice was soft and gentle. It was already dark outside. She held Qiao Song's fingers. Qiao Song was used to pretending in front of the camera, but she wasn't as averse to it as before. She lowered her eyes, "What's wrong?"

Her eyelashes were long, and her lower eyelids cast a dark shadow.

Pei Ning rubbed her cheek against her arm, tilting her head up and smiling, "I like you!"

Qiao Song's cheeks flushed.

She pinched Pei Ning's nose. "...Stop rubbing."

She paused, "Your makeup's ruined; all the foundation is on my clothes."
