Chapter 10

Qiao Song stiffened.

She hadn't expected Pei Ning to be so proactive.

The cameramen outside couldn't follow them in and hadn't noticed them hiding there. She felt a little awkward. "Why are you hugging me? Don't you want to do the show anymore?"

Pei Ning didn't seem to care. He pressed against her and mumbled softly, "I came to this show for you. If you ignore me, if you're upset with me, I don't want to play the games."

She felt wronged.

Qiao Song tilted his head slightly upward, his chin resting comfortably on Qiao Song's head.

Qiao Song let her hug her, her voice muffled, "We don't want the gold leaf anymore. Do you want zombies to come knocking on our door if we stay here?"

"No."

Pei Ning looked up at her angrily, her pink lips pressed against her chin.

Pei Ning didn't let go, hugging her even tighter, "I didn't mean to hurt you. Last time, my cousin took it upon himself to say he'd stand up for me. I was afraid something would happen to you, so I went. I didn't let him humiliate you."

Afraid she wouldn't believe her, Pei Ning grumbled, "You didn't even give me a chance to explain, making me cry for so long. My eyes are swollen from crying. I had to put on makeup for ages today, couldn't you tell?"

Pei Ning waited for her response, clearly dissatisfied.

Qiao Song looked down at her; her eyes were indeed a little swollen, but it wasn't very noticeable with makeup.

Qiao Song reluctantly replied, "...I can tell."

"Hmph!"

Pei Ning gave her a "See? I knew it" look, complaining softly, "You don't believe me, you won't listen to my explanations, you misunderstand me, you hurt my feelings, and you ignore me. I've waited for you for so long, and you still haven't replied to my messages."

Pei Ning listed her transgressions, "They say this kind of behavior is called passive-aggressive behavior, it's unacceptable, and it will damage the relationship!"

Qiao Song: "..."

Pei Ning accused, "Don't you like me anymore?"

"Ah—"

Qiao Song quickly explained, "No, I don't."

She was a little dizzy from this sudden blow.

Pei Ning met her gaze with almond-shaped eyes. "You said on the show last time that you really liked me, that I was your favorite person. I believed you. Did you keep your word back then?"

Qiao Song: "...Um..."

That was just for the sake of making the show more interesting!

But meeting Pei Ning's clear eyes, she struggled for a long time before failing to utter an explanation, "...Of course it counts."

Pei Ning's resentment vanished instantly, replaced by a beaming smile, "I knew it! You're not a player, you wouldn't lie to my feelings."

Josong: "!!!"

Of course she wasn't...

Pei Ning lifted the barefoot Jo and planted a quick kiss on her chin, "I love you the most too. I liked you from the first moment I saw you. I want to be with you forever, to share all my joys and sorrows with you."

"Thump thump thump—"

Josong blushed deeply, her heart pounding.

The soft, yielding touch on her chin seemed to vanish in an instant.

Her breathing was rapid, her mind like a machine with broken chains, struggling to keep up. Qingtuan: "Ahhh!!! It's gone up!! It's gone up!! Master, your progress bar has gone up!!!"

Pei Ning: "Hehe, I told you! As long as I let Qiao Song know that there are people in this world who love her and wholeheartedly support her, she won't fall! She will definitely be saved by me!"

Qingtuan: "Ahhh! It's soared to 15%!!! More than all of yours before!"

Pei Ning pursed her lips, secretly delighted. Observing Qiao Song's expression, she noticed that Qiao Song had turned her head away, seemingly lost in thought. She tilted her head to look at her. "Qiao Song, we've made up, right?"

Qiao Song's face tightened, trying to be serious, but her bright red ears betrayed her.

"...Yes."

It seemed that besides this word, she had no other words to answer.

Pei Ning was overjoyed.

Just then, a drone hovered above the courtyard, and the sight of the two embracing was instantly seen by netizens across the country.

The comments section exploded: "Holy crap! All the other couples are on the run, but this pair is actually dating!"

"Gotcha! Gotcha! They're glued together, aren't they?!"

"Ahhh! So sweet!!! This is a real couple!!! I'm definitely going to be the top couple today!!!"

The comments section was flooded with messages. Realizing the drone was there, Pei Ning let go of Pei Ning's hand.

Qiao Song quickly took the string of gold leaves and stuffed it into Pei Ning's bag, then put the rope with a gold leaf attached into his own bag.

"Josong, why did you only take one?"

Pei Ning asked, puzzled. Josong didn't even look up. "One is enough. If we're both being chased, you hide with the gold leaf. I'll distract them. That way, our losses will be smaller."

Pei Ning panicked. "Then let me distract them—"

"You can't."

Josong swallowed hard. "Your legs are short; you can't run fast."

Pei Ning: "???"

That's going too far with the personal attack.

Josong observed that there were no zombies or other team members outside, so he slowly opened the door, looking for another way out.

If they stayed in this courtyard, they would be found sooner or later. They didn't have nearly enough gold leaves.

Night was falling.

The entire ancient city seemed shrouded in an invisible shroud. Whether for the sake of the show or to enhance the game experience, NPCs, seemingly useless but harmless, kept popping up.

For example, there were women and children dressed in ancient costumes, begging for food and doing small business.

There were also passionate young men vowing to wipe out the Xiongnu, and an elderly storyteller with white hair.

Eerie, deep music echoed through the ancient city, sounding strange and chilling.

The production team had clearly invested heavily in this live broadcast.

The other two couples were already in a sorry state, fleeing for their lives, chased by zombies for several blocks.

Qiao Song pulled Pei Ning along, carefully moving her along the corner.

Pei Ning gripped her backpack tightly, also observing her surroundings.

Her hearing was exceptional; she sensed no danger and, not hearing any footsteps, wasn't particularly nervous. However, Qiao Song remained constantly on edge, wary of a zombie suddenly appearing to claim her life.

"Gurgle, gurgle—"

Her stomach was growling loudly and rapidly.

Pei Ning quickly clutched her stomach, meeting Qiao Song's gaze as he turned. A little embarrassed, she chuckled, "I'm a little hungry..."

It wasn't entirely her fault.

When she was a koi spirit, she didn't need to eat. Having only recently become human, she didn't really know what hunger felt like. However, these past two days, she had been so heartbroken that she had no appetite, and only when her stomach growled did she realize she hadn't eaten all day.

Qiao Song frowned, glancing at her watch. "There's a food exchange shop here. I'll take you there to eat."

If she left Pei Ning waiting here, she wasn't sure if they would encounter zombies or other humans on the way.

Going with her was clearly the safest course of action.

Pei Ning's face contorted in confusion. She shook her head. "Let's save the gold leaves. We only got one. Everyone else probably got a lot. If we come in last—"

"Then you can continue to go hungry?"

Qiao Song flicked her forehead, annoyed. "You're still growing; you can't go hungry."

Comments: "Ahhh! That doting tone! That sweet..." "What an amazing move! Grandpa told me the CP I ship is real!!!"

Comments: "Waaaaah, this is what good love is like. I can't bear to see you suffer, and you can't bear to see me go hungry, waaaaah..."

Comments: "I've realized Qiao Song really treats the young lady like a child, it's killing me!!!"

Pei Ning smiled sweetly at her, a smile that melted away the ice, as radiant as a sunflower.

Comments: "Ah, I'm dead! I'll protect that smile of the swan!!! This isn't just a shameless social media star, this is a heartwarming little angel!!!"

Comments: "Will the government issue girlfriends like this? Where can I get one? Single dogs are waiting online, it's urgent."

Comments: "Hey, go get one in your dreams, you can have anything in your dreams."

The two secretly hugged in the yard that afternoon, and it immediately went viral.

#PerfectMatch

Their CP (couple) hashtag has grown to over 100,000 fans since its inception.

Their interactions on the show have been edited into countless creative segments.

It's been widely circulated on various video websites.

Pei Ning's Weibo account was originally mostly filled with inactive fans and paid trolls; even her national fan club was outsourced by her manager.

The head of her fan club was actually a fan leader from another group.

After the CP (couple pairing) trended on social media, her Weibo follower count skyrocketed, and the number of genuine interactions per post jumped from just over a hundred to over three thousand.

While the numbers weren't particularly impressive, it was a good start for Pei Ning.

Heart in turmoil: "CP fans, get ready! Today is New Year's for us CP fans!!!"

Hua Pipi: "Who wouldn't say it's sweet! Qiao Song and Pei Ning are the best! From now on, if anyone dares to say anything bad about these two, I'll fight them!"

Fox Not Stupid: "Dark circles/dark circles/dark circles/Finally, a sister discovered my treasure! This CP is so addictive! I fell into the pit last week and haven't gotten out! I stayed up several nights to collect all the trash, and my mom asked me if I was stealing cows every night, sob sob sob."

The comments section is filled with laughter.

CP fans are pushing this everywhere, while the Qiao Song fan group is in an uproar.

Qiao Qiao: "Isn't it enough that the production team is profiting off us? Pei Ning has such a bad reputation, they're obviously just trying to get us, Qiao Song, to promote her! Please, company, stop them! We've already ruined her public image!"

Qiao Qiao When Will You Marry Me: "Speechless! Qiao Song has been in the industry for so many years, always focusing on her talent. They randomly paired her up with a CP (couple pairing), and it's a washed-up celebrity with such a terrible reputation! Pei Ning's fans are practically setting off firecrackers in front of our door!"

Qiao Song's Leg Accessory: "@Administrator @Assistant @Studio They're bullying us right at our doorstep, and you're just going to stand by and watch?!"

Qiao Song has several fan groups, mostly with long-time fans.

The first fan group consisted of the original members, and their voices carried weight.

A group of them started flooding the chat with comments, causing a commotion, and the staff dared not utter a word.

After all, the show was still live, and it was a dating reality show; none of them had expected the fans to have such strong opinions about Pei Ning.

When their arguing subsided and the chat became less busy, a newcomer, who had somehow infiltrated the group, popped up.

It's Qing Tuan: "Whispering, Qiao Song doesn't have as many resources as Pei Ning, okay?"

Qiao Song's Wife: "???"

Singing for You: "???"

Song Ah Song: "???"

It's Qing Tuan: "Whispering, the dating variety show is a hit, Qiao Song is more valued by businesses, she'll get more collaborations and scripts in the future, it can only benefit her career, right?"

Ah Qiao Baby: "???"

Qiao Sweetie: "???"

It's Qing Tuan: "Whispering, Pei Ning isn't as bad as you guys say, is he?"

The next second, a group message notification.

"The administrator has kicked 'It's Qing Tuan' out of the group."

Qing Tuan: "..."

Qing Tuan: "Pouting/Unhappy/"

Can't people even speak the truth!
