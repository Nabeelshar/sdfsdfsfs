Chapter 17

“If this is your attitude and stance, then I think there’s no need to continue this conversation.”

Pei Ning sat up straight, holding the cake to have the waiter pack it up, but Qiao’s mother panicked and quickly stood up.

“Do you really want Qiao Song to be ruined like this? Don’t think I don’t understand this industry. She has no acting opportunities now! This industry is all about youth; in a few years, when she’s older, she won’t earn any money! And she’ll have a reputation for sleeping around everywhere! Her father and I haven’t slept for several nights in a row because of her. We’ve gone to great lengths, all to give her a future!”

Mother Qiao scoffed, “You can play around however you want, your family is rich, everyone in Beijing knows how powerful the Pei family is! But we can’t afford to waste Qiao Song’s potential! You can pretend nothing happened in a couple of years and marry any rich guy, but not Qiao Song! In the end, she’ll be the victim!”

Pei Ning shook her head, her face showing complete disapproval.

She was somewhat shocked. "Auntie, in my eyes, Qiao Song is a gentle, considerate, persevering, and opinionated girl. She's not only beautiful, but she also knows exactly what she wants. In the entertainment industry, this big melting pot, she's never followed the crowd. She's always insisted on being herself, but—"

She didn't understand. "Why, in your eyes, all her strengths have become rebelliousness and stubbornness? Everything she's gained in this industry—fans, fame, fortune, money—you see it all as something she easily obtained by relying on her looks. This is truly—"

She laughed angrily, staring at Qiao's mother's face, enunciating each word clearly, "How could you so casually erase all her efforts? How could you so easily shatter her dreams?" "

Mother Qiao's lips moved, her expression somewhat strange.

Pei Ning's eyes were red and swollen as she stared intently at her. "Haven't you ever, for even a minute, not even a second, felt any pity for your daughter who's struggled and endured so much hardship in the entertainment industry?"

"That...that's all her own fault!"

Mother Qiao's voice lacked conviction; her hand clutching the documents trembled slightly. She looked directly at Pei Ning. "What do you know? You're a rich second-generation, you've had whatever you wanted since birth. Our Qiao Song is different from you! From now on, stay away from my Qiao Song! Or don't blame me for being impolite!" "

Pei Ning's gaze remained calm, her body ramrod straight, showing no fear whatsoever despite the threat.

She didn't refute, only chuckled softly. Mrs. Qiao, enraged, shouted, "What are you laughing at!"

Pei Ning sighed silently, "I'm laughing at you, Auntie, desperately trying to use Qiao Song to prove your own life. How pathetic."

Mrs. Qiao's face paled, anger rising, her phoenix eyes blazing with fury. Pei Ning smiled, "You just want to prove you're a good lawyer, a good wife, a good mother, so you treat Qiao Song like a toy in your plan. She must grow according to the model you gave her; her birth, aging, sickness, and death are all controlled by you, without the slightest mistake." "She laughed. 'Although this kind of controlling behavior is a kind of illness, as an outsider, I still find it disgusting. No matter what choices Josong makes in the future, as her friend, I can't just leave her like this.'

She blinked, holding back her tears.

'If you don't want her, I will. But if you continue to try to throw dirty water on her, or recklessly stab her, I will absolutely not allow it.'

Her face was stubborn. 'You don't love her, but I do.'" Silence reigned all around.

It was as if you could hear the wind blowing in from outside the coffee shop.

Mother Qiao's face flushed with anger. Pei Ning stood there stubbornly, then footsteps sounded behind her. Then, a cold hand took hers, soft yet reassuring.

Qiao Song's curly hair was tied in a low ponytail, and she was still wearing the same clothes from that morning. She didn't look at Pei Ning, but calmly looked at Mother Qiao. "That's enough." "

Mother Qiao's face turned ashen. She had no idea when Qiao Song had arrived, or how much of their conversation he had overheard. She wanted to explain, but Qiao Song had already pulled Pei Ning by the hand and was walking out.

Qing Tuan: "Master, Master, your progress bar is moving at breakneck speed! It's almost halfway there!"

Pei Ning remained expressionless, showing no sign of joy whatsoever.

Qing Tuan: "Master, what's wrong? Your progress bar is moving so fast, aren't you happy?"

Pei Ning clutched her heart, muttering, "Happy."

Qing Tuan: "?"

Happy, yet you have such a long face?

Pei Ning: "I'm just a little heartbroken." She glanced at Qiao Song's tense profile, then looked away, staring at the road ahead. "My heart aches for Qiao Song..."

She couldn't describe the feeling; she just wished she could bear all the blame herself.

How could someone as precious as Qiao Song have to carry such a heavy burden?

Pei Ning's nose stung, and tears welled up uncontrollably. At first, she managed to hold back her sobs, but then her shoulders began to tremble, and Qiao Song noticed.

Qiao Song stopped and turned to look at her. "Pei Ning?" "

Pei Ning lowered her head, sobbing uncontrollably. "I'm sorry, I wanted to stop crying, but I couldn't help it. Qiao Song, I'm sorry, I was so useless just now. I... I should have told her not to humiliate you like that. I didn't do a good job, I..."

The more she cried, the more tears streamed down her face.

No matter how much she wiped, the tears wouldn't stop.

Pei Ning, exasperated, said, "Why are there so many tears..."

Qiao Song suddenly hugged her tightly. The two stood on the shaded path behind the coffee shop, flanked by tall locust trees.

The rain had stopped, but there was little moonlight; the dim yellow light from the streetlights shone brightly through the treetops.

There were few people on the path.

Josong took out a tissue and gently wiped away her tears.

Pei Ning, who had been unable to control her emotions, slowly calmed down at this moment, sobbing against Josong's shoulder.

Josong She patted her back intermittently.

After what seemed like an eternity, the chirping of crickets came from the grass, voices could be heard at the end of the road, and the sound of bicycle bells rang. Pei Ning slowly straightened up, her eyes a little swollen, but thankfully she hadn't cried.

“Qiao Song, I'm sorry…”

Pei Ning lowered her head, gripping her fingers tightly, utterly sincere. “I… did many things that were bad for you before, things that… negatively impacted your career. If I said those weren't my intentions, you might not believe me, but I deeply regret it now, truly…”

The original owner had instigated people to target Qiao Song; Qiao Song couldn't possibly have been unaware.

Those things the original owner did, while not entirely Pei Ning's fault, but—

Whose fault could it be?

“Alright.” "

Qiao Song was clearly reluctant to continue the conversation. "The past is the past. Let's not bring those things up again."

She didn't want Pei Ning to continue blaming herself.

The Pei Ning of the past life and the Pei Ning of this life were completely different.

She didn't need to shift the blame for Pei Ning's mistakes from the past life onto the Pei Ning of this life.

Qiao Song had figured it out herself.

Pei Ning finally dared to look up at her, her eyes sparkling, asking expectantly, "Really?"

Qiao Song nodded, giving a emphatical "Mmm," "If you don't believe me, hook it up."

She held out her little finger, and Pei Ning happily held out her little finger as well. Just as they hooked onto Qiao Song's, she froze, bursting into tears, "My cake!" "I didn't get my cake back! I only ate two bites!"

She turned to go back to the coffee shop to get it, but Qiao Song grabbed her wrist. "I'll buy you a new one, you don't need that one."

Who knows if she'll run into Qiao's mother again when she gets back.

Pei Ning said regretfully, "That cake was delicious, chocolate flavored, better than any cake I've ever had before!"

After saying that, she looked at her empty hand and almost cried again, "I forgot my umbrella there too!"

Qiao Song couldn't help but laugh.

Pei Ning looked up at him with red eyes. Qiao Song pursed his lips, his tone very gentle, "It's good that the umbrella is lost."

She added, "We can buy a new one." "

The umbrella is lost, but it won't fall apart.

Pei Ning's gaze towards her was filled with a strange look again.

The two walked hand in hand back to the villa. Pei Ning asked her, "Auntie said you went back to be with Grandma. Why are you back so soon? Is Grandma alright?"

"She's fine."

The streetlights cast long shadows of the two. Qiao Song said calmly, "I just got to the airport when I received a call from Grandma. She said she wasn't sick at all; my parents made her pretend to be sick to deceive me. Grandma said she didn't know why my parents made her do it, but she felt it was wrong to lie to me, so she contacted me."

Upon hearing this, Pei Ning finally understood.

"So, all of this was arranged by your mother herself." "
"She said, bewildered, "Then your mother has a deep misunderstanding about you."

It was evident from their conversation tonight.

Istance is a knife.

The more you try to pull it out, the deeper it stabs.

Qiao Song scoffed, "It doesn't matter."

She said calmly, "I don't care."

Perhaps she would have cared before, but after hearing Pei Ning's words tonight, she truly didn't care anymore.

Let whoever wants it.

From now on, she would only be herself.

-
After that day, Qiao Song moved into Pei Ning's villa.

Pei Ning complained that living alone was too lonely, and besides, Qiao Song would be going to the film set soon, and then returning... The apartment... if she encountered Qiao's mother's harassment, it might affect her condition.

News of their relationship was making headlines online.

But neither Qiao Song nor Pei Ning responded.

After all, the dating reality show was still filming, and they were essentially a public couple; the truth or falsehood was left for others to judge.

Pei Ning followed Qiao Song, treating it as... A happy little bug, spending her days eating and sleeping.

Soon it was time for the live broadcast of the third episode of the dating reality show.

Because they won first place in the previous episode, this time their trip was to an island.

The production team thoughtfully booked a double room for the two of them.

In the five-star island hotel, Qiao Song and Pei Ning each had their own bed. Pei Ning screamed with excitement; she and Qiao Song always slept alone at home.

For some reason, Qiao Song always locked the door before going to bed every night.

It annoyed her a lot.

Now, although the hotel arranged for each of them to have their own bed, at least they were in the same room!

Pei Ning hugged Qiao Song and whispered, "Qiao Song, from now on, we can chat together at night!" "

Josong: "..."

No, she didn't want to.
