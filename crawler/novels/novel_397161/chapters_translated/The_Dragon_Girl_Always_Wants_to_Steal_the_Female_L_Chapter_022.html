Chapter 22

From the villa to the airport, and even until boarding the plane, Pei Ning chattered incessantly beside Qiao Song. They had booked business class and sat side-by-side, with Aunt Zhang sitting behind them, separated by a curtain.

Qiao Song was looking down at her script when Pei Ning leaned closer and asked, "Qiao Song, you still haven't told me how you got the director to agree to let me join the cast?"

When she first said she wanted to join the cast, the director was terrified. How did Qiao Song manage to get it done so easily?

Qiao Song stared at the script, but her mind couldn't concentrate at all. She twirled a page with her fingers and didn't turn it over for a long time. "It's not difficult. I just said that you are willing to learn and promise to perform well, and the director agreed."

Pei Ning looked suddenly enlightened and said happily, "Qiao Song is still awesome."

Qiao Song turned a page, and Peining came over again, "Qiao Song, can I ask you a question?"

She bit the straw and slowly drank the orange juice. Qiao Song swallowed subconsciously and straightened her voice, "What's the problem?"

Pei Ning's smile deepened and he looked at her with ill intentions. "That day I jumped into the sea, and even though you're not a very good swimmer, you still came to save me, wasn't it..."

Qiao Song: "No."

Pei Ning: "?"

Qiao Song glanced at the dazed Pei Ning and said seriously, "I saved you just because I didn't want you to get hurt. It was instinct. If it had been someone else who fell into the water that day, even a cat or dog, I would have saved them too."

She felt her words were absurd after saying them. She glanced at Pei Ning and saw her pouting, looking sullen. Qiao Song thought about it and realized that what she had just said might have been hurtful. She clearly didn't mean it that way.

She tried to explain, "Actually, to me, you..."

"Okay."

Pei Ning absentmindedly jabbed the orange juice through the straw. "I thought Qiao Song risked her life to go into the sea for me..."

Qiao Song opened her lips, wanting to explain, but Pei Ning looked up at her with a grin, "But knowing Qiao Song didn't, I'm relieved!"

Qiao Song: "...Huh?"

Pei Ning took a sip of orange juice. "But, Qiao Song, if this kind of situation happens again, whether it's a cat, a dog, or a person, don't risk your life to save them."

She was very serious. "Your life is very important."

Qiao Song was stunned.

She quickly looked away, wanting to drink some water, but when she picked up the cup, she realized it was empty.

She heard Pei Ning's cheerful voice, "I thought Qiao Song did this for me. Knowing it wasn't, I'm relieved! Qiao Song needs to protect herself before she can protect others, hehe, my Qiao Song is so kind!"

Qiao Song swallowed hard.

She wanted to say, no.

It's not like that.

Having lived a second life, she cherished her life immensely. If it were someone else,

she wouldn't have rushed into the sea.

Qiao Song didn't know why, but her heart felt heavy, as if she couldn't breathe. She looked at Pei Ning again; Pei Ning was shaking her head, sipping orange juice, slowly reading the script, taking a sip and sighing. Noticing her gaze, she turned back and gave her a sweet smile.

Qiao Song: "..."

She took a deep breath and continued flipping through the script.

The filming of "A Century of Glory" took place in Hengcheng and Northwest Film Studio. Qiao Song had more scenes in Hengcheng, and Pei Ning was there to accompany him. The two stayed in a large hotel suite with only one large bed. As soon as Pei Ning entered the room and saw the bed, she became excited and jumped on it, rolling around several times.

“Josong!!! You can finally sleep with me!!!”

Aunt Zhang, who was carrying luggage at the door, blushed upon hearing this. “Miss, take it easy. Miss Qiao is here to film a movie, not to go on vacation with you. Keep your voice down, don’t let anyone hear…”

Pei Ning sat up in bed, her hair a mess. Hearing Aunt Zhang’s words, she scratched her head. “I didn’t say anything, I…”

She looked at Josong, who was already busy packing his things, pretending not to have heard their conversation.

Pei Ning: “…”

She muttered under her breath, “Sleeping with Qiao Song, is that something shameful?”

She snorted, “I just like sleeping with Qiao Song…”

Qiao Song, who was packing her luggage: “…”

She turned her back, quickly gathered her luggage, and ran away as if her life depended on it, “I’m going to see which other teachers are coming.”

Once she left, the room door closed. Aunt Zhang finished packing and saw Pei Ning lying on the bed playing Candy Crush. She said helplessly, “Miss, I think Miss Qiao is quite nice. Don’t just play around and end up hurting her feelings.”

“Huh?”

Pei Ning, who was munching on a lollipop, looked at her blankly.

Aunt Zhang sighed and secretly pulled a bunch of colorful finger tweezers from her bag. "Miss, you've always been willful. You were so obsessed with that pretty boy before, it's fine that it ended, but I can tell Miss Qiao is a good girl. Don't be fickle and hurt her feelings."

Pei Ning glanced at the finger tweezers, tilted her head to look at Aunt Zhang, "I wouldn't hurt Qiao Song's feelings. What are these for?"

Aunt Zhang coughed lightly, "These are for when you and Miss Qiao sleep..." "I'll put your things away for you, Miss. Usually, I put them under your pillow or in the bedside table so they're easy to take out when needed, and it also helps prevent infection and keep germs away."

Pei Ning seemed to understand, but then rolled over and continued playing her game, swinging her legs. "Then put them away for me before you go out."

Aunt Zhang beamed. "Okay!"

Aunt Zhang divided the pile into several parts: some in the drawers, some under the pillow, some in the suitcase, and some in the coat pockets.

She thought that Qiao Song didn't seem like someone with that kind of addiction, but her young mistress might be.

Chasing after Qiao Song, even insisting on following him to the film set to suffer—how much does she like him? How much does she want to be close to him?

Remembering what she'd seen at the door that day, Aunt Zhang cleared her throat. "Miss, you should do this in moderation, especially since Miss Qiao works so hard filming. If you can control yourself, please do so. Don't exhaust Miss Qiao, understand?"

Pei Ning frowned and tilted her head to look at Aunt Zhang.

She was just sleeping with Qiao Song, was this really necessary?

Aunt Zhang was so long-winded.

Pei Ning said impatiently, "I know."

Aunt Zhang could tell Pei Ning wasn't willing to respond, so she smiled and left, telling Pei Ning to call her if she needed anything.

Pei Ning shook her head, continuing to play her match-3 game. "This is so strange..."

Many actors came today. The director had previously met with the cinematography and art direction teams. Today, the actors got to know each other, did their makeup and styling, and tomorrow there will be a script reading, rehearsals, etc. Filming will officially begin in two days.

Qiao Song was also called in for makeup and styling.

Qiao Song plays a wealthy heiress who, in the face of national crisis and a matter of great importance, is willing to sacrifice herself for the cause. Her character is very positive. Pei Ning, however, somehow convinced the director that her character would be this wealthy heiress's classmate.

This means that in the early scenes, they will be together most of the time.

Later, Hu Ling, played by Qiao Song, focused on her career, while Wang Chunhua, played by Pei Ning, took a different path—

she married a local tycoon.

These former close friends, one dedicated herself to the country, enduring hardship,

while the other frequented lavish establishments, losing her way in the dazzling lights and decadent lifestyle.

In the end, in a moment of crisis, the tycoon's business failed, and he fled abroad with his wife and child, only to be robbed and die a tragic death. Wang Chunhua and her child were rescued and reunited with Hu Ling, who had already made a name for herself.

The two former friends, one dedicated to her country and its people, the other only seeking a stable and wealthy life.

As someone escorted Wang Chunhua away, she and Hu Ling exchanged a glance. That single glance sealed their fate; they never saw each other again.

"Wang Chunhua's biography is just as I wrote. In her early years, she was a lively young girl whose only dream was to marry a rich man and become a carefree wealthy wife. She and Hu Ling grew up together, but later their paths diverged completely."

After Qiao Song finished taking the official photos, she explained the character to Pei Ning in the room. "She watched Hu Ling dedicate herself to this career with disdain and disdain, thinking they were crazy, foolish." "It's amazing! The plot twists and turns in the early and later parts need to be convincing; you have to portray the character's multifaceted nature."

Qiao Song was quite worried. "We have a script reading tomorrow, and maybe a whole day of rehearsals. Can you... do it?"

Pei Ning, chewing on a lollipop, tilted her head to look at her. "Qiao Song, are you worried about me? Will I make mistakes during the reading?"

Actually, she was just a nobody, and might not even participate in the reading.

But Qiao Song was still helping her, probably afraid her acting would drag the show down, which wouldn't just be a delay in the schedule.

With so many veteran actors and artists, she was afraid Pei Ning would get scolded.

Some veteran artists can be even more scathing in their criticism than the director. Qiao Song nodded, without any hesitation. "Xiao Ning, your acting skills... aren't great, but as long as you observe carefully, learn diligently, and imitate well, you can produce good performances. Can you do that?"

After all, the previous Pei Ning had absolutely no respect for acting.

She didn't even memorize her lines for filming. If she brought that kind of attitude to the set of *A Century of Glory*, the director wouldn't care who it was; everyone would be furious.

"I can do it."

Pei Ning wasn't worried.

She had at least attended a training course before, and Qing Tuan said her acting wasn't too bad. As long as she learned from Qiao Song every day, she could produce decent performances.

Qiao Song smiled with relief.

She chose to believe in Pei Ning.

“Everyone’s having dinner tonight. The director said he wanted me to take you with him. You can have a good talk with him then. He’s giving you this opportunity because he wants you to reach new heights and not stagnate.”

Josong handed Pei Ning a notebook and got up to find a pen. “You really want to be an actor; you can’t miss this opportunity.”

Josong couldn’t find one, so he casually opened a drawer on the bedside table.

Inside the drawer, a bunch of brightly colored finger t-shirts lay quietly.

Josong turned to look at Pei Ning.

Pei Ning lay on the bed, legs swinging, tilting her head thoughtfully as she looked at her notes. "Qiao Song, you're amazing! You wrote so comprehensively."

Not getting a response from Qiao Song, she turned to look at her. Seeing Qiao Song's face flushed, she sat up. "Qiao Song, what's wrong?"

Qiao Song couldn't utter a word for a while. She paused, took a deep breath, and said, "Did you put all of this here?"

Pei Ning peeked at the colorful things, chewing on a lollipop, and mumbled, "Yeah, I can use it when I sleep with you."

Qiao Song's phoenix eyes widened: "?"

Pei Ning climbed to the head of the bed, patted the pillow, picked it up, and quickly moved it aside. Underneath the pillow was a pile of colorful packaging.

She smiled smugly, "There are still a lot more here!"

Josong: "...???"
