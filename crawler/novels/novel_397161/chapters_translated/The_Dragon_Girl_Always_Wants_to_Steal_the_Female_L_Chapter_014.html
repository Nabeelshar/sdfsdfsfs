Chapter 14

The two spoke in hushed tones, hidden under the table. The indoor security camera only captured the motionless wooden table; what was happening underneath remained a mystery.

Comments: "Could these two be doing something naughty under the table?!"

Comments: "Even if they did, it wouldn't matter, it'd be perfectly legitimate, hahaha."

Comments: "Stop talking nonsense and start shipping! Tonight is the wedding night for this CP!"

A group of people followed behind, laughing heartily.

Pei Ning cautiously glanced at Qiao Song. The room was still dark. Qiao Song was lying on the floor, one arm draped over her back, his hand sliding down to hug her waist.

Qiao Song was staring intently at the gap under the red cloth, observing whether any more zombies would sneak in.

Pei Ning moved closer to her. Qiao Song turned to look at her, unable to see her face, but subconsciously frowned, trying to quiet her down.

Pei Ning leaned in and pecked her cheek. Qiao Song's arms around her waist tightened. Pei Ning chuckled softly, then, like a woodpecker, pecked her cheek several more times.

Qiao Song couldn't take it anymore and pressed her face down. "Stop it."

His voice was clear and calm, revealing no emotion.

She shoved Pei Ning away with her hand. Pei Ning giggled and snuggled against her. Qiao Song gave a short, disdainful "Hey!" Pei Ning knew that if she moved any further, Qiao Song would get angry, so she obediently stayed still in her arms.

Qing Tuan: "It's rising! It's rising! It's rising so fast!!!"

Qing Tuan: "You two are making rapid progress, turning green!!!"

Qing Tuan: "Go, Master!!!"

Pei Ning was a little proud. No matter what, Qiao Song liked her!

This night was a bit agonizing.

After the zombies were completely gone, Pei Ning and Qiao Song searched the hall thoroughly several times, confirming there were no relics. They then crawled under a wooden table to rest.

When it was fully light, around seven in the morning, Pei Ning, unwilling to give up, searched again with Qiao Song.

Finally, they found a note with the words "relic" written on it in the scripture pavilion on the second floor.

Pei Ning: "..."

The director is too much.

The result was predictable: their team won, collecting a considerable amount of gold leaves. Nie Suisui and Qin Chen's team, despite Pei Ning providing gold leaves and medicine, were bitten by zombies again, this time suffering fatal injuries, and their mission failed.

The production team gathered everyone for a few games and lunch, then let the couples go on dates. The live stream ended after dinner.

Pei Ning took a hot shower, rinsing several times, changed into clothes smelling of soap, and tied her hair in a simple ponytail. She texted Qiao Song, saying she wanted hot pot for dinner.

Qiao Song readily agreed.

A photographer was following them, and the two strolled hand-in-hand, attracting a crowd of onlookers. Pei Ning finally got her wish and ate an ice cream. When they arrived at the hot pot restaurant, watching the various elaborately posed photos, Pei Ning happily rubbed her hands together.

Then, Pei Ning saw the waiter bring over a plate of fish slices.

Pei Ning's expression froze. Before she could recover, the waiter brought over a plate of fish heads…

Pei Ning's smile gradually faded, and looking at the bubbling four-compartment soup pot, her initial enthusiasm vanished.

Pei Ning: "..."

Pei Ning: "...I don't eat fish."

She glanced at the waiter, "Please take this away."

The waiter glanced at the staff; Qiao Song had already noticed Pei Ning's expression and quickly removed the dish. "Here's the menu. Would you like to order anything else?"

Pei Ning's eyes lit up again when she saw the menu. "I want seaweed! Seaweed knots! Big shrimp! Lots!"

Qiao Song asked the waiter to change the dishes.

Pei Ning happily waited for the seaweed to be served when Qiao Song's phone suddenly rang. Qiao Song saw the caller ID, her expression momentarily serious. She glanced at Pei Ning, then casually hung up. Just as she hung up, the phone rang again.

Qiao Song smiled faintly, "I'm going to take this call."

Pei Ning nodded obediently, waiting for the seaweed to be served. She lowered her head to drink her eight-treasure porridge, savoring its sweetness. After finishing a mouthful, she licked her lips, contentedly taking another sip.

Qiao Song glanced at her, then turned and went into the bathroom to answer the phone.

A stern, cold female voice came from the other end of the line: "You've really disgraced the Qiao family! Your cousin said you were dating a minor actor, and we didn't believe it. What are you doing?! Qiao Song, there's a limit to your rebellious behavior!"

Qiao Song hadn't expected that her mother, whom she hadn't contacted for almost two years, would launch into such a tirade on the phone.

She gripped her phone, her body terribly stiff. She thought about how she had lived those twenty-odd years before her rebirth.

She was required to be flawless, impolite, and never overstep boundaries.

She always had to be number one in her exams; she had to live according to her parents' plans; she had to…

become the person they wanted her to be.

Sometimes, Qiao Song even suspected that she wasn't the product of her parents' love, but merely a tool for their boasting and control.

A low, cold laugh escaped Qiao Song's throat, like sarcasm, or perhaps self-mockery.

Hearing the commotion, Qiao's mother snapped on the other end of the phone, "Did you hear me?!"

Qiao Song snapped out of her reverie and mumbled a curt "Yes, I heard you" into the phone.

Her tone was indifferent, devoid of any emotion.

Mrs. Qiao breathed a sigh of relief. "You're not allowed to go on those kinds of variety shows again! It's broadcast nationwide! If your grandma saw this, she'd be mortified! Luckily, your cousin reminded me, otherwise I wouldn't even know—"

"Isn't that unnecessary?"

Qiao Song's voice was low, yet incredibly sharp.

These words silenced Qiao's mother's nagging. She thought she'd misheard. "Qiao Song, what did you say?!"

Her voice rose several octaves. "How can it be unnecessary! Do you really want to be with that little actress?! I told you that industry is filthy! You insisted on going in! Who taught you this?! You get back here right now! Do you really want to be an actress your whole life?!"

Qiao Song felt a tightness in her chest, as if it were stuffed with cotton and then filled with water.

The heavy feeling made it hard to even breathe.

She knew she didn't need to explain anything.

She gripped her phone, feeling too weak to utter another word.

Qiao Song heard the bathroom door open and gave a soft "heh," almost a laugh. "I'm still working. We'll talk later."

Then she decisively hung up and pressed the power button.

It wasn't Pei Ning who came in. Qiao Song inexplicably breathed a sigh of relief, touched up her makeup in the bathroom, and then returned to her seat.

Pei Ning sat there obediently, several plates of seaweed in front of her.

Seaweed strips, seaweed knots, seaweed slices.

Qiao Song raised an eyebrow, and Pei Ning waved to her with a bright smile. "Qiao Song! I've cooked your favorite beef tongue! The timing is perfect! It'll be delicious!!!"

She used long chopsticks to pick up a piece of beef tongue and placed it in a clean bowl, also removing a few peppercorns and chili pepper skins from the top.

The gloom in Qiao Song's heart vanished instantly, like a long-awaited ray of sunshine suddenly shining into a cold abyss.

Pei Ning continued picking at her food, chattering, "Qiao Song also really likes fatty beef, lamb rolls, and egg dumplings with lotus root and meat filling."

She scooped up all the food she was talking about and placed it in Qiao Song's bowl.

Qiao Song looked up and met Pei Ning's smiling eyes.

Qiao Song's lips unconsciously curved into a smile, without her even realizing it.

Pei Ning poured her orange juice, then picked up her own seaweed slices, nibbling on them like a little rabbit gnawing on a radish. Noticing Qiao Song's gaze, she paused, looked up at her, and urged, "Eat up!"

Qiao Song seemed to snap out of a daze, lowering her head to pick up the hot food from the bowl; the steam from the hot pot was a little too hot.

It was so hot that tears almost welled up in her eyes.

The live stream ended after the hotpot meal. Qiao Song wasn't going back to the hotel; she had to rush back to Beijing that night for an audition early the next morning.

She'd lost too many resources before, and it would take time to gradually regain them.

The popularity she'd built up through variety shows had given her a chance to turn things around, but currently, she didn't have many good scripts. Her company had almost blacklisted her before, and although the Pei family wasn't targeting her anymore, her manager still didn't dare allocate her with top-tier resources.

If it weren't for the Pei family's suppression, she would have been the company's top artist long ago.

She was the one choosing the scripts; no script would reject her.

On the plane, she saw Pei Ning already seated next to her.

They were in business class.

Pei Ning's nanny and her assistant sat behind her, separated by a curtain. As soon as Qiao Song sat down, Pei Ning hugged her arm and leaned in.

Qiao Song was about to get angry, but looking at Qiao Song's innocent and sweet face, all her anger vanished.

She didn't know why.

They both ate a very large meal that evening. Qiao Song read a script, while Pei Ning sat beside him playing a match-3 game. She was wearing headphones, and every now and then she would tilt her head and glance at Qiao Song, as if looking at something curious.

When she looked back, Qiao Song was looking up at her. Pei Ning smiled shyly, buried her head in Qiao Song's shoulder, and continued playing the match-3 game.

Qiao Song: “…Pei Ning, why are you looking at me like that?”

Pei Ning rested her chin on Qiao Song's shoulder, the pressure surprisingly not hurting much.

Pei Ning whispered in her ear, “Qiao Song, if I'm not livestreaming, can I come visit you?”

Her tone was very serious. Qiao Song's hand, holding the script, paused, her ears turning slightly red. “Aren't you working?”

“Nobody's offering me acting roles, and nobody wants me to act. I don't seem to be very popular.”

Pei Ning hummed and hawed, “Can I?”

She wanted Qiao Song to answer her previous question.

Qiao Song's gaze was fixed on the script, but his thoughts were elsewhere. "We'll see."

Pei Ning wasn't annoyed. She smiled and continued playing her game. Once the plane landed in Beijing, Qiao Song waited for his assistant to get the luggage. She sat down in the lounge area and took out her phone, only to realize it was switched off and still not on.

She thought for a moment and then turned it on.

After a few seconds of response, a series of text messages flooded in.

Mom: "Break up with that Pei guy right now! You two aren't right for each other! Don't follow bad influences from outsiders! I heard you're not getting any good roles these days. Your dad and I told you to study law and become a lawyer like us, but you refused. Now look what's happened! Live-streaming your relationship is utterly shameful!"

Mom: "Your grandma's health is getting worse and worse. She even took care of you for two years! There's a limit to your filial impiety! You're really trying to drive us crazy, leaving us with no one to rely on!"

Mom: "I'm waiting for you at your apartment! I know you're coming back tonight. Let's see how long you can hide! If you're so capable, then don't come back at all!"

Qiao Song deleted each message expressionlessly.

Then he saw her latest post.

Mom: "There are plenty of good men in the world. Your dad and I have found one for you—a promising young man from our law firm. He's thirty-five, divorced only once, and has no children.

If you marry him, you'll have no worries about food or clothing. You just need to have two children with him. He doesn't mind that you've worked in that industry, or that you're a bit unkempt. Listen to me, I'm your mother. Would I harm you?"

Josong's hands trembled.

"Josong..."

She heard a soft, sweet voice behind her.

Josong pretended to brush her hair aside, trying to compose herself.

She turned around and saw Pei Ning clutching her clothes, looking at her with a pitiful expression. "I don't want to go home alone. It's so dark, I'm so scared. Qiao Song, can you sleep with me tonight...?"
