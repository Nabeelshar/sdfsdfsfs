Chapter 11

The place to exchange food was in a bustling area of the ancient city.

Zombies were rampant in the city, and at night, every household kept their doors tightly shut.

Qiao Song and Pei Ning finally found a sesame seed cake shop. A banner reading "Da Lang Sesame Seed Cake" hung at the entrance, but the door was only slightly ajar, and it looked dark from the outside.

Pei Ning subconsciously grabbed Qiao Song's hand, weakly asking, "Qiao Song, are there any zombies in here?"

Qing Tuan: "...You're a carp spirit, you might not even be afraid of real zombies, let alone these fake ones!?"

Pei Ning: "This is called creating atmosphere, what do you know!"

Sure enough, Qiao Song squeezed her fingers tightly, his voice gentle, "Don't be afraid, if there are zombies, we'll just run."

Pei Ning, pleading, clung to Qiao Song, looking like she was saying, "I'm so scared, whatever you say is right." Qiao Song gently pushed the wooden door, which creaked open.

Pei Ning huddled close to Qiao Song, her head tucked in. Qiao Song, mustering her courage, looked around.

The sesame seed cake shop was empty; only a dim candlelight illuminated the main hall. Qiao Song cleared her throat and called out, "Is anyone there?"

Afraid the shopkeeper wouldn't hear her, Qiao Song called again, "Excuse me, is anyone there?!"

A cough followed, sounding like an elderly man.

Qiao Song reacted quickly, stepping back and nearly bumping into Pei Ning. Pei Ning, holding her fingers, peeked out from behind her and immediately spotted an elderly man in simple clothes descending the stairs.

The old man, hunched over and looking quite old, slowly descended the stairs, carrying a lamp.

His voice was hoarse. "Who is it?"

"Grandpa, we've come to buy some sesame cakes. Do you have any?"

Pei Ning, seeing he wasn't a zombie, mustered her courage and asked. Hearing this, the old man slowly walked towards them, raising the lamp. After seeing their faces clearly, he sighed heavily. "Judging from your attire, you're not from Pingcheng, are you?"

"Yes, we've come to visit relatives."

Qiao Song answered for Pei Ning, shielding her behind him and watching the old man warily.

Upon hearing this, the old man wore a complex expression. "Seeking refuge with relatives?"

The old man sighed and shook his head. "Our Pingcheng is a dead city now. What relatives are there to seek refuge with?"

His eyes held a hint of sadness. "I don't sell any sesame cakes, but I do have some food. If you can do me a favor, I'll give you some dry food."

Pei Ning and Qiao Song exchanged a glance, confirming the old man wasn't a zombie, before relaxing a little. "What kind of favor?"

The old man, trembling, leaned against the shop... He sat down at the table, his eyes somewhat clouded. "My name is Old Man Li. I originally had two sons and a daughter, but my two sons were bitten by zombies and turned into zombies themselves. This sesame seed cake shop originally belonged to my sons, but my daughter and son-in-law took it. Those two were afraid my little grandson would be eaten by zombies, so they took him and hid in narrow alleys..."

The old man sighed softly, "When they left, they were afraid the sesame seed cake shop would be robbed, so they asked me to guard it here. It doesn't really matter to my old bones, but..." "The shop doesn't have much food left. Let alone making pancakes, even basic sustenance is a problem..."

He gazed at the empty street outside, his eyes deep and unfathomable. "Back then, I promised my wife I would protect our children. Now both sons are gone, only this daughter remains. I beg you, take the remaining food from home to them. I'm willing to give you ten percent as a reward..."

"They only care about money. They don't even care about your safety, and you still want to find a way to send them food? What kind of world is this?" "As their children?"

Pei Ning indignantly retorted, "Even if you painstakingly try to send them food now, they might not appreciate it!"

"This old man doesn't have many days left to live..."

The wrinkles around the old man's eyes deepened; he was emaciated and pale from long-term malnutrition. "I, Old Man Li, am begging you two. If you can successfully deliver the food to my daughter and grandson, you will be my family's benefactors. I will kneel before you..."

The old man trembled as he prepared to kneel before the two men.

Qiao Song quickly helped him up, "Grandpa, please don't!"

Pei Ning also hurriedly agreed, "We'll help! We'll help! You don't need to do this."

The old man finally relaxed, a slight smile appearing on his face, "I'll go get it for you, you wait here."

Pei Ning and Qiao Song watched the old man take the lamp and go into the kitchen.

A short while later, the old man came out with two bundles.

One bundle had a large character for "grain" on it, the other bundle contained compressed biscuits, bread, and sausages—foods that could quickly fill the stomach.

The old man patted the bundle with his withered hands and said earnestly, “This is my last food. You must deliver it to my daughter and grandson. This bundle is my reward to you; it will last you for a while. Perhaps she will give you some reward too when you find my daughter—”

The old man saw them out of the sesame seed cake shop. His thin frame stood at the doorway, waving and calling out, “My daughter’s name is Li Erya. You must find her!”

Tears welled in the old man’s eyes, a sight that tugged at the heartstrings.

Comments: "Waaaaah, this old man is so pitiful."

Comments: "The production team really put in the effort. This immersive filming makes me feel like they've traveled back to ancient times."

Comments: "Thank you, grandpa, for bringing food to my baby! I hope you're alright, waaaaah..."

Josong separated the dry food and put it in her and Pei Ning's bags.

The dry food was divided into two categories: bread and sausages, and soda crackers. Josong put these in Pei Ning's bag.

The remaining compressed biscuits and whole wheat bread went into Josong's bag.

After putting everything away, Qiao Song slung the bundle with the large character for "grain" printed on it over her shoulder, but positioned it in front of her to avoid being attacked from behind.

Pei Ning tilted her head to look at her. "Qiao Song, is this grain bag heavy? Should I carry it?"

Qiao Song shook her head. The bag probably contained cushions; it was light and didn't weigh much.

She glanced at her watch. "It's 9 PM. Our food, if eaten sparingly, should last until the morning after tomorrow. But if we don't complete the mission, we might be punished. Tonight, we won't look for anyone. We'll find a place to rest to avoid being constantly chased by zombies."

At this moment, the walkie-talkie began to warn: "There's a temporary relief point west of the ancient city, guarded by Taoist priests and local people. We can temporarily hide and rest there."

They hadn't seen any refugees along the way, so they must have all gone there.

Following the map on their watches, Qiao Song led Pei Ning to the temporary relief point in the west of the city.

They ate something to fill their stomachs along the way and even evaded two zombies.

The temporary relief point was essentially a gathering place for distributing blankets; long, cool mats were laid out, and one could lie down and sleep anywhere.

Men and women lay separately. Some were already asleep, while others sat on the mats, complaining of hunger, and the occasional cry of a child could be heard.

For a moment, Pei Ning felt a sense of disorientation, even wondering if it was all real.

When Qiao Song and Pei Ning arrived, the Taoist priest in charge of managing the beds took inventory, then stroked his chin with a troubled expression. "There's only one cooling mat left, not enough for you two. Why don't you look elsewhere?"

"No! We've come all this way, we can't just leave like this!"

Pei Ning grabbed Qiao Song's hand and pushed her forward. "We want one too, she can sleep there."

Qiao Song turned to look at her, her brow furrowing slightly.

The temporary relief station was lit by lanterns. Seeing Pei Ning's serious expression, Qiao Song paused for a moment, then looked at the Taoist priest. "One is enough. We won't sleep at the same time."

Golden leaves and food are valuable items; one of them must guard them.

If the production team arranged for someone to steal it, their mission would fail.

Upon hearing this, the Taoist priest had no choice but to assign them a seat and give them a brand-new cotton quilt.

The temperature difference between day and night is significant in the north; even in summer, the nights are chilly. Both were wearing short sleeves, and the quilt helped keep them warm.

The remaining seat was in an inconspicuous corner, separated by a wooden board, and not very well-ventilated.

Qiao Song didn't put down her bundle, but instead whispered to Pei Ning, "You go to sleep first, I'm not sleepy yet."

Pei Ning looked at the narrow mat, less than a meter wide, plopped down, and patted it beside her. "Qiao Song, let's sleep together."

She tugged at Qiao Song's sleeve, her almond-shaped eyes sparkling with cleverness. "We're thin, we can squeeze in. It's so cool at night, what if you catch a cold?"

"I won't—"

Qiao Song's ears turned slightly red. It was just sleeping on a mat together, just sharing a blanket, why was she—

her heart beating so fast?!

"Then if you won't sleep, I won't sleep either."

Pei Ning pouted and muttered, "Let's sit together and share the blanket, that way neither of us will be cold."

As she spoke, she unfolded the blanket and covered herself with it. She had long since lost her shoes, and the blanket made her much warmer.

Qiao Song looked at her helplessly. Pei Ning's eyes were wet with tears. "If you don't want to, then I won't use this blanket either. We'll both freeze."

Qiao Song rubbed her temples. The woman next to her, who had been sleeping with her back to her, scolded impatiently, "Shutting around so late, can't a person get any sleep?!"

Pei Ning, scolded, shrank further under the covers, only her eyes peeking out as she stared intently at Qiao Song, as if inviting him. Qiao Song sighed almost inaudibly. She lifted the blanket and placed a bundle with the word "grain" on it for Pei Ning to use as a pillow.

Pei Ning happily hugged the bundle and lay down on her side. Qiao Song followed suit.

Cameras were installed under the red lanterns, several cameras following her. Qiao Song's temperature was normal, but her arms were a little cold after running around all night.

The warm quilt was quite relaxing, even though the mat beneath her was hard and cold. It offered considerable comfort to her tired body.

Although Qiao Song was lying down, she didn't dare to completely relax. They had food and gold leaves on them, and there was no way to prevent other team members from taking them.

The seats were small, and Pei Ning was very close to her. With her back to Pei Ning, she could even feel Pei Ning's breathing.

Pei Ning was petite and had been running around barefoot all day. Qiao Song thought that when they got up, she would let Pei Ning wear her shoes.

Just then, a soft, fluffy bundle hugged her from behind.

Pei Ning felt a surge of heat, her arms encircling Qiao Song, her face pressed against Qiao Song's neck, she gave a sweet breath, and whispered, "Qiao Song, you smell so good!"

Qiao Song grabbed her hand, her face flushed, and whispered, "What are you doing?"

"I'm sleeping with Qiao Song in my arms, so I'm not afraid she'll leave me and run away."

Pei Ning rubbed against her back, and through her T-shirt, Qiao Song could feel how deeply Pei Ning depended on her.

“I love Qiaosong the most.”

Qiaosong’s heart skipped a beat. She barely dared to breathe, her body tense, until she heard even breathing behind her and the arm around her waist went limp. Only then did she breathe a sigh of relief.

Afraid of waking Pei Ning, she remained in that position, afraid to move.

Qiaosong didn’t dare to turn over that night. The next morning, just as dawn broke, the chilly air of the ancient city opened her eyes. She had just woken up when she heard a child crying, “That’s my mother! Don’t move! You mustn’t touch her!”

Qiaosong sat up, checked that everything was still there, and then relaxed.

Only then did she see a five- or six-year-old child crying heartbreakingly.

“Your mother has been bitten by a zombie for a month! Luckily, a Taoist priest performed a ritual on her this past month! If we don’t burn her soon, she’ll turn into a zombie! If you keep crying and making a fuss, we’ll throw you into the zombie pile!”

The old woman who had slept next to her yesterday also woke up, sat up to tidy the quilt, and shouted, “Everyone knows your mother robbed your two older brothers of their pancake shop! She doesn’t care about your maternal grandfather, she killed your uncle, and she even killed your father! If we don’t burn her, are we going to let her turn into a zombie and bring misfortune upon us?!”
