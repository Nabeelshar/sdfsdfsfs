Chapter 12

"No, it's not like that!"

The child cried out in despair, "My mother starved to death! She was bitten by the zombies because she starved to death! She won't become a zombie, she definitely won't! Don't burn my mother!"

The child struggled to rush towards the "corpse," but the Taoist priest held him firmly. Tears streamed down the child's face, his lips trembled, and his eyes closed in despair. He was too grief-stricken to utter a sound.

Pei Ning silently stood beside Qiao Song, carrying dry food in one hand and a bundle in the other. She noticed Qiao Song wasn't wearing shoes, tucked the bundle under her arm, and went back to his sleeping spot to get his shoes.

Flustered and clumsy, completely lacking the imposing presence of the Dragon Girl.

Qing Tuan: "..."

Unable to bear watching.

Qiao Song was squatting down, wiping the child's tears.

Comments: "Holy crap, I just woke up! What's going on? This kid's acting is amazing!"

Comments: "Isn't that the kid who played the little emperor in 'The Great Emperor'?! Absolutely incredible! The production team really knows how to find gems!"

Comments: "Pei Ning is scared stiff, hahaha..."

Qiao Song made the Taoist release his grip, raised his head, and pinched the child's arm. The child was covered in dust, his makeup was filthy, and his hair looked like it hadn't been washed for months and was matted together.

Josong asked hesitantly, "Your mother, did she starve to death?"

The child wiped away tears, only for new ones to flow. He slowly opened his eyes, looking at Josong through blurry vision, and after a long pause, choked out, "Yes..."

"My father was a schoolteacher. After the zombie outbreak in the city, he went to help deal with the zombies. He left and never came back... My mother took me to seek refuge with my two uncles, but they were both bitten to death by the zombies." "...

The child wiped away tears with her small hands. "Later, Grandpa said he could support us. My mother didn't want to be a burden on him, so she lied to him, telling him to stay at the pancake shop and sell pancakes, and not to run away. She wanted to take me and hide with my father..."

The child's cries were heart-wrenching. "But my mother only took enough food for me to survive! She didn't want Grandpa to die, so she left all the food for him!"

Qiao Song didn't speak.

She just thought of what Old Man Li had said and the food he had given her.

She gently patted the child's head, her voice soft and tender. "Is your mother named Li Erya?"

The child cried out, "Yes..."

"This child has no parents now. We can't just leave him here. His maternal grandfather runs a sesame seed cake shop, right? We can just send him back to him!"

"Easy for you to say. Who among us dares go that way? That's..." "It's the most bustling place in the whole city; those zombies are just waiting there to ambush people!"

"But we can't just leave this little brat here, he's crying like crazy every day."

The people at the relief point were gossiping. Qiao Song wiped the child's tears without saying a word. Even in this disheveled state, she was still beautiful. Her curly hair was messily tied up, revealing her profile, and her phoenix eyes seemed to see right through the world.

Pei Ning silently placed her shoes beside her.

Qiao Song noticed and turned to look at her. Her dark eyes were expressionless, and Pei Ning had no idea what she was thinking.

Pei Ning spoke up, "Josong, we can take him home."

Josong hesitated for a moment, then spoke into the walkie-talkie, "If you successfully complete the main quest, you will receive five hundred gold leaves."

Pei Ning's eyes lit up. Wasn't this a win-win situation?

Josong wiped the child's tears and turned to get his shoes. Pei Ning thought she was going to put them on, but Josong ordered her, "Lift your left foot."

Pei Ning was confused, but obediently lifted her left foot. Her socks were already filthy, but Josong didn't care and just grabbed her ankle.

Pei Ning recoiled in fright, nearly getting kicked by Qiao Song. Qiao Song had already pinned her foot down and shoved it into his white sneakers.

"Qiao Song!"

Pei Ning exclaimed, her almond-shaped eyes widening in surprise.

Pei Ning: "Qiao Song actually gave me her shoes to wear!"

Qing Tuan: "?"

Qing Tuan: "Is this something to be excited about? Your progress hasn't increased at all!"

Pei Ning: "This means Qiao Song cares about me! Qiao Song can't bear to see me without shoes! See, see, I told you, I've already won her over!"

Qing Tuan: "???"

Pei Ning: "It must be because I held her while she slept last night, warming her up! Making her feel loved! So now she's repaying me in her own way! Ahhh!"

Pei Ning: "Qiao..." "So cute!"

The left shoe was already on. Qiao Song easily slipped it on by fiddling with the heel with her index finger. Seeing that she was about to take the other shoe, Pei Ning stomped on her left foot and muttered, "Qiao Song, these shoes aren't good for escaping. Going barefoot is much more convenient. I'd rather not wear shoes."

Qiao Song looked up, as if checking if she was lying. Pei Ning said seriously, "I'm serious! I lost my own shoes running away. Wearing yours would definitely make it harder to escape, so I'm not wearing them. Qiao Song, I'll take them off for you."

She gently stepped on the heel of her right shoe, and it came off easily.

Qiao Song raised an eyebrow. She had considered Pei Ning's reasons for refusing, but she hadn't expected this.

"I really can't force her to wear them."

Qiao Song calmly tossed the shoes aside. "Since it's easier to run away barefoot, I'll go barefoot with you."

Pei Ning stared at her with wide, incredulous eyes, speechless with surprise for a long time. Qiao Song stood up, preparing to take the child back to the pancake shop, when Pei Ning suddenly hugged her.

Qiao Song was a little taller than Pei Ning, so Pei Ning's hug resulted in her wrapping her arms around Qiao Song's neck, her face nuzzling against Qiao Song's, as happy as a child who had received candy.

Qiao Song subconsciously wanted to push her away, but her hand stopped abruptly.

Even she didn't know why.

It seems—

If only I could be hugged for a couple more seconds, if only it were Pei Ning…

…it wouldn't be such a bad thing.

Qiao Song heard Pei Ning chuckle softly in her ear, “Qiao Song, you're so sweet.”

There was no lingering clinging as she had imagined; Pei Ning only hugged her for a few seconds before letting go.

Only after her sweet scent disappeared did Qiao Song realize what had happened. Her ears turned slightly red, but her tone was deliberately serious, “From now on, no more misbehaving during missions.”

Pei Ning, carrying her various bags, didn't mind her sullen face at all, and smiled even more happily, “I know!”

Qing Tuan: “…Facepalm.”

Pei Ning: “Hehe, Qiao Song is so good, after all that yesterday…” "Netizens joked that my shoe fell off, and her fans even called me a calamari. Qiao Song must have sensed something, so she's facing this with me! She's firmly on my side!"

Qing Tuan: "...Don't listen to the CP fans in the comments...They're obsessed, they're talking nonsense. And 'calamari' doesn't mean you look like one, it means—"

Qing Tuan suddenly stopped talking.

Pei Ning: "What?"

Qing Tuan: "...Never mind."

If Pei Ning really figured it out, who would complete the mission?

Who cares if it's a black cat or a white cat, as long as it catches mice, it's a good cat. No matter what method she uses, as long as she can recall this wisp of the God's soul, that's all that matters.

Qing Tuan: "I think you're right, but to save her as quickly as possible, I suggest you learn how to develop a relationship with her while you're on the run."

Pei Ning: "I know how."

Pei Ning: "Leave it to me!"

Qing Tuan: "..."

Something feels... a little off?

Qiao Song and Pei Ning, carrying all their belongings, embarked on their return journey. The child, named "Little Bean," despite his young age, was a natural actor, completely immersed in his role, as if he himself were that poor child who had lost his mother.

Qiao Song watched him the whole way, feeling inexplicably heartbroken, though he didn't know why.

Before setting off, the Taoist priest at the aid station gave them a peach wood sword. This sword could be used to kill any zombies they encountered; each zombie killed earned them one gold leaf.

However, the zombies would retaliate, and they might even encounter a zombie king, in which case success was not guaranteed, and they might even be bitten and assimilated.

Everything carries risks, but Qiao Song didn't care, and neither did Pei Ning. As long as they got through tonight, they would have successfully completed their mission. Whether they had many or few gold leaves, she would face it together with Qiao Song.

Josong led the way, successfully slaying several zombies and collecting some gold leaves along the way. They also completed the obstacle course set by the production team. By the time they returned to the sesame seed cake shop, it was already 5 PM.

The two of them had to get back to the temporary relief center before dark; otherwise, with the full moon tonight and the zombie outbreak, staying there would be certain death.

Josong froze upon arriving at the sesame seed cake shop.

The brightly colored "Dalang Sesame Seed Cake" banner from last night was long gone, torn to shreds and lying at the entrance.

As if realizing something, Josong pushed open the door of the sesame seed cake shop.

The cameraman followed behind, filming. Upon entering, the sesame seed cake shop was dilapidated; the tables and chairs were covered in dust and cobwebs, looking nothing like a place anyone lived in.

Pei Ning, holding Xiao Douzi's hand, had intended to bring her inside, but she first saw the "mummified corpse" sitting in the corner. Pei Ning quickly covered Xiao Douzi's eyes and carried her outside.

A refugee suddenly appeared outside the door: "That old man Li, I told him to run away, to run away quickly, maybe there would still be some hope, but he insisted on staying here, and he starved to death half a month ago! He insisted on waiting for his daughter, but who can even see where his daughter is!"

The short man shook his head, "Afraid the zombies would disturb him, he scattered glutinous rice around him before he died. What good did it do? Eating that stuff would have kept him alive for a few more days, but without it, he would have starved to death!"

He picked up a broken bowl, shook his head, and left, muttering, "Starving to death, starving to death!"

Pei Ning's eyes were wet as she watched the man leave.

Comments: "Ahhh, so what they encountered yesterday was a ghost! The daughter left food behind and starved to death, but the father kept waiting for her to come home! Ahhh!"

Comments: "I miss my dad. Every time I come home, he and my mom feed me lavish meals. Then one day I raided their place and found them eating steamed buns and kimchi. We're not poor..."

Comments: "To the lady in front, your family isn't poor, but your parents only wanted to give you the best... I'm really crying my eyes out."

A bunch of comments were cursing the production team for being too cruel.

Pei Ning and Qiao Song buried the "corpses," then, with Xiao Douzi in tow, didn't know where to go. They reminded each other on the walkie-talkie that the gold leaves had arrived.

Just then, a loud shout rang out, "They're over there! They have food and gold leaves!"

Pei Ning looked and saw Qin Chen and Nie Suisui, both disheveled, their clothes tattered and their faces covered in dust. She wanted to ask if they needed help, but Qiao Song grabbed her arm and whispered, "They're our competitors, don't go over there."

Pei Ning hesitated for a moment, intending to leave with Xiao Douzi, when Nie Suisui cried, "Pei Ning! I'm starving! Can you..." "Give us some food!"

"No!"

Qiao Song quickly refused. "We don't have any extra resources for you. We have a child with us, and we need more than you do!"

"Are you just going to leave us to die?!"

Nie Suisui looked at the two of them desperately. "We came to the city together! We're not zombies, we're human! We can't compete with you, but if you give us just a little food, we can make it through!"

"Rules are rules."

Qiao Song remained expressionless, pulling Pei Ning and Xiao Douzi away from them. "If you can't take it, you can give up and ask for help. We won't offer any assistance."

"Qiao Song!"

Nie Suisui cried for help, but Qin Chen looked disappointed. "Forget it, Suisui, I don't care if I starve to death, Suisui, as long as you live!"

Comments: "Qiao Song is so heartless! She's begged like this! She'll even raise a complete stranger's child, why can't she help her own kind? Hypocritical!" Comments: "The person in front doesn't need to do that. Qin Hao was bitten by a zombie and injured. They don't have enough gold leaves to buy medicine. These guys are here to steal gold leaves. They've already taken down Sun Qiuming and Tang Weiwei. It's normal for Qiao Song to be on guard!"

Comments: "Ahhh, Pei Ning is walking towards them with food! Is she going to give them food?! Ahhh! Goose, don't be stupid!!!"
