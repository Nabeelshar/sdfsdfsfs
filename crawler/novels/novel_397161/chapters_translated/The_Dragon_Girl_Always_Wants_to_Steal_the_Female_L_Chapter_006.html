Chapter 6

Comments: "Hahaha, Qiao Song, you're so straightforward!"

Comments: "Everyone saw that, right? Qiao Song is single because of her own merit."

Comments: "Pei Ning's flustered little eyes are so adorable!"

Pei Ning pouted and took a lollipop out of her bag to eat.

Comments: "Just noticed now, even the young lady eats a five-cent lollipop!"

Comments: "Does anyone really believe female celebrities love candy? They're too busy trying to resist sugar, and now they're putting on this persona."

Comments: "If you don't want to watch, just get out, okay? Arguing and acting like a moral paragon?"

Comments: "+1"

Comments: "+phone number"

Comments: "+ID number"

Pei Ning: "..."

Netizens are so boring.

Back at the hotel, the director had the guests collect their confession gifts individually.

After receiving the gifts, they could confess to the person they liked.

Pei Ning was arranged after Qiao Song, and when she went, she unsurprisingly received a crystal bracelet.

Pei Ning beamed, clutching her gift, and headed to find Qiao Song.

The director cautioned, "Don't get too excited yet. Lu Jinxiao also went to confess to Qiao Song with a gift. Maybe Qiao Song won't accept yours?"

Pei Ning turned and glared fiercely at the director. "How could that be!"

Even though she was wrong, she was still indignant.

If that bastard Lu Jinxiao really went to confess to Qiao Song, she'd unleash a full-blown shark attack! That scumbag doesn't deserve love!

The live chat exclaimed: "She's panicking! She's panicking! She's chasing after her with a bracelet!"

The live chat continued: "Hilarious! Lu Jinxiao's leaf isn't even that competitive, is it?"

The live chat exclaimed: "That's too much! My brother begged for a whole day to get that, and it's not just any leaf, it's a beautiful bookmark!"

The live chat erupted. Following Qing Tuan's directions, Pei Ning found Qiao Song.

Sure enough, Qiao Song was standing with Lu Jinxiao under a peach tree, adorned with twinkling lights.

Lu Jinxiao had changed into a clean suit, while Qiao Song wore a grass-green dress, her wavy hair casually clipped back with a pearl clip, large triangular earrings dangling from her round earlobes. Her makeup was largely unchanged, except for a retro-colored lipstick.

The two stood facing each other, turning around at the sound.

Qiao Song saw Pei Ning, her eyes showing slight surprise, but she didn't say anything, simply crossing her arms and glancing at Lu Jinxiao in response.

Pei Ning was still dressed the same as today:

White shirt, plaid skirt, pigtails, and a bunny ear headband.

Fine beads of sweat glistened on her nose from rushing over.

She stood there holding the gift box, and when she saw the two talented people, she felt sour for some reason, as if someone was twisting them with their hands, like twisting a towel. The harder she tried, the more her heart ached.

Her eyes were red. She stood not far from them, as if she had been abandoned. Her eyes were wet, which was hard to see, and she was really pitiful.

Lu Jinxiao hadn't given out the gift in his hand yet. He just glanced at Peining and felt a little proud when he saw Peining was so aggrieved, as if he was here to attack the heartless man.

He said, this eldest lady is obviously obsessed with him, how could she lose the novelty all of a sudden and still be good friends with Qiao Song?

Now, in front of the entire nation, does she have to act like she likes him a lot?

Lu Jinxiao, holding the gift, felt a little uneasy—

What if Pei Ning, for his sake, went and started a fight with Qiao Song in front of the whole country?

Whose side should he take?

Lu Jinxiao was torn.

He glanced down at the tattered leaves in the box.

Just some random leaves the production crew grabbed at the hotel.

Because of this, two girls are going to fight over him.

Tsk.

These girls are too easily satisfied.

Lu Jinxiao coughed, wanting to give Pei Ning some space for now.

He stepped forward, about to grab Qiao Song's hand, but Qiao Song flinched. Lu Jinxiao smiled and said, "Qiao..."

"Qiao Song!"

Pei Ning rushed forward, quickly and forcefully pulling Qiao Song back. Qiao Song almost lost his balance, but Pei Ning quickly and firmly embraced his waist!

Lu Jinxiao narrowed his eyes, his face saying, "Woman, see? I knew you were jealous." He feigned ignorance, his tone completely innocent, "Pei Ning, what are you doing? I'm confessing to Qiao Song!"

Pei Ning pulled Qiao Song behind her, biting her lip, blocking her view, and raised her chin, looking at Lu Jinxiao with a serious expression. "Qiao Song won't accept!"

She looked like a raging little tiger.

Lu Jinxiao laughed in exasperation. Did this woman really want to confess to him in front of the entire nation's netizens?

He was straightening his suit, preparing for Pei Ning's dramatic confession, when he saw her turn around, grab Qiao Song's hand, and complain tearfully, "You promised to accept my gift! How could you accept his!"

Lu Jinxiao's faint smile faltered.

Lu Jinxiao: "?"

Lu Jinxiao: "???"

Wait, he was all set up to receive the gift, couldn't Pei Ning see him?

Did she mistake Qiao Song for him?

Has Pei Ning developed cataracts? Is her vision failing her?

Qiao Song felt a pang of sadness seeing her cry so bitterly. She never imagined that scumbag Lu Jinxiao would have the nerve to confess to her.

If she were Lu Jinxiao, she wouldn't even offer a single leaf!

"I didn't agree to accept his gift."

Qiao Song didn't have any tissues, and seeing her tears welling up, she simply wiped them away with her own hands.

Her fingers were very white, and her movements were gentle. Pei Ning's tears were warm, but her heart was warm.

Live comments: "Ahhh, the delivery couple is real! The production team is so bold! These two are a perfect match!"

Live comments: "Lu Jinxiao's stunned expression just looks like me from before, hahaha, I'm laughing so hard I'm croaking."

Live comments: "Hahahaha, poor Lu Jinxiao, he spent all day begging for food just to find love, and someone else stole it from him, hahaha."

Looking at the two who were about to hug, Lu Jinxiao finally understood what was going on.

He held the box, his face filled with shock. "It's not just two people! Shouldn't things be done in a first-come, first-served manner? I invited Qiao Song first, Pei Ning, you see—"

Pei Ning seemed not to hear him at all, solemnly shoving the gift box into Qiao Song's hands. Seeing Qiao Song accept it, she turned to look at Lu Jinxiao, her expression both cute and fierce, "Qiao Song has already accepted my gift, he won't accept yours. You can go back now!"

Comments: "Go back" "Brother, why put up with this when you should be acting? Coming to a dating show and having to beg for food, not even getting a chance to confess your feelings, and you still think you're not embarrassed enough?"

Comments: "Hahaha, the girl is so cute! She and Qiao Song are a perfect match, I approve of this marriage!"

Comments: "Program crew, have some humanity! My Jin Xiao brother came to participate in a dating show, why can't he even be paired with a female guest?!"

The comments started surging again.

Qingtuan: "Master, the increased buzz in the comments about your friendship with Qiao Song is helping to speed up the progress!"

Pei Ning: "OK!"

Qingtuan: "...Where did you learn that?"

Pei Ning: "I learned it from the comments! So cool!"

"To be fair, I asked Qiao Song out first, and I haven't even given him the gift I prepared yet. At least we should compete fairly and let Qiao Song choose for himself, instead of you forcing a gift on him, right?"

Lu Jinxiao was unwilling to give up.

Pei Ning sneered inwardly. The whole nation knows your gift is just a leaf, what's the point of choosing?

Pei Ning tugged at Qiao Song's sleeve, her fierce demeanor vanishing. "Qiao Song, just tell me what kind of tree's leaves you want, and I'll bring you a whole tree when we get back. It won't be like that jerk... He's so stingy, only giving you a single leaf!"

She was especially sincere, her clear black eyes seeming to say, "Don't choose him, choose me."

Qiao Song's lips curled into a smile as he looked intently at her. "I also have a gift for you."

Pei Ning's mouth dropped open in surprise, and she excitedly pointed to herself. "Me? Me? I really have a gift from Qiao Song?"

Qiao Song smiled and nodded. He took a box from the photographer and handed it to Pei Ning, saying, "I've been waiting for you, I thought you weren't coming. This gift is something I chose for you."

Comments: "Ahhh, mutual love! Yuri is the best! I'm shipping them to death!"

Comments: "So sweet! So Qiao Song wasn't even planning to accept Lu Jinxiao's gift!"

Comments: "Qiao Song and Pei Ning are so disgusting! They're not rejecting leaves, they're rejecting my brother's sincere heart!"

This comment was followed by a few scattered comments about Lu Jinxiao.

Most of them were accusing the production team and Qiao Song and Pei Ning.

The live chat was filled with comments:

"No way! It's just a dating show, and your idol already has the script! If you're so rude, tell him not to come!"

"I've always thought his fans were weird, and seeing is believing. Thank goodness my sister didn't choose him."

"Haha, where do those arrogant looks from the fans and the idol come from? Do they think your idol is an emperor?"

The comments section was buzzing with discussion.

"Want to open it and see?"

Qiao Song raised an eyebrow. "Maybe you'll like it."

Pei Ning held the small gift box, her nose tingling slightly. She murmured, "No one has ever given me a gift before..."

Her voice was soft, and the others didn't hear her clearly, but Qiao Song did.

She was somewhat surprised.

Pei Ning, being a pampered young lady, should have received countless gifts growing up, yet she was saying—

She'd never received a gift before?

Qiao Song lowered his head slightly, trying to see her expression clearly, when Pei Ning looked up and smiled, "Shall I open it?"

Seeing Qiao Song wink in tacit agreement, her smile deepened. She slowly removed the bow from the box and gently opened the lid.

It was the swan necklace.

A small white swan sat on a silver chain.

Waiting alone for its owner to arrive.

Pei Ning's eyes lit up with surprise, even a hint of delight. "So beautiful..."

"Would you like me to put it on you?"

Seeing her like it, Qiao Song was very pleased; after all, this was the best gift she could get.

"Okay!"

Pei Ning was overjoyed. Qiao Song put it on her, and then Pei Ning put the moonstone crystal bracelet on Qiao Song's wrist. After they exchanged gifts, Pei Ning hugged Qiao Song's arm, acting coquettishly, and asked her if she liked her.

The two of them noticed Lu Jinxiao still standing there.

Qiao Song smiled and ignored Lu Jinxiao, looking at her with a smile, "Of course I like you, I like you the most."

Pei Ning smiled and tiptoed to give her a quick kiss on the cheek. Lu Jinxiao stood there, holding the cardboard box, watching the two walk away. He heard Pei Ning ask Qiao Song, "Why isn't Lu Jinxiao leaving? Is he going to confess to someone else?"

Then he heard Qiao Song reply casually, "I don't know, maybe."

Lu Jinxiao: "..."

The camera was off. Lu Jinxiao took out his phone and typed a bunch of messages to Qiao Song, "I don't think we're a good match. How about we stop contacting each other for now, and we can talk about collaborations later—"

He had barely sent the first part, before he could type the second, when a big red exclamation mark appeared next to the message.

Lu Jinxiao: "?"

Lu Jinxiao copied and resent the message.

It was that same red exclamation mark again.

He copied the message and sent it to Pei Ning, assuming she had blocked him too, but to his surprise, she replied quickly.

Pei Ning: "?"

Pei Ning: "Are you crazy?"

The next second, a notification appeared that she was no longer his friend.

Lu Jinxiao: "?"

Lu Jinxiao: "???"

He came to participate in a dating reality show, and both of his potential romantic interests ran away?!

...

"Qiao Song, thank you for the gift."

After seeing Qiao Song to her room, Pei Ning looked at her reluctantly, "We'll be parting ways tomorrow. What... what are your work arrangements for the future?"
