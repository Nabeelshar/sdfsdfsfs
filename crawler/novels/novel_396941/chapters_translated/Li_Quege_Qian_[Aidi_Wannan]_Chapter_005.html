Chapter 5

At the dinner table, Tang's parents were very hospitable, and Wen Yanhe politely chatted with them.

Tang Xuyu sat quietly to the side, eating his meal.

Out of the corner of his eye, Wen Yanhe noticed that Tang Xuyu's cheeks were bulging from eating, which looked quite adorable.

After the meal, unable to refuse, he took a few photos with Tang's parents.

Tang's parents continued chatting with Wen Yanhe, smiling.

Tang Xuyu glanced at the three chatting happily on the sofa, then turned and went back to his room.

While washing up, he thought about his scenes for tomorrow; he needed to check them before going to sleep.

He really hoped Tian Xinyuan was the second male lead! He'd heard they hadn't found their ideal second male lead yet. Perhaps I could recommend him to them; Tian Xinyuan's personality is quite suitable for the second male lead.

Tang Xuyu picked up a towel to dry his hair, opened the door, and went out.

Qin Yuan would be perfect to play Tian Xinyuan's wife. Hmm, those two could also do cameo roles. I wonder what their expressions will be when they find out they're playing a couple.

Tang Xuyu smiled.

After drying his hair, he lay in bed and read the script for a while, leaving a small nightlight on for Wen Yanhe, then closed his eyes and went to sleep.

The next morning, Tang Xuyu ate breakfast and waited for Wen Yanhe to go to the film set together.

After finishing his makeup, Tang Xuyu went to discuss the casting with Li Yueyue and Qu Sisi.

Knock, knock.

Li Yueyue looked back and saw Tang Xuyu. She immediately asked, "Is something wrong, Xiao Tang?"

"Director, weren't you worried about the two second male leads and two guest actors?"

Qu Sisi immediately knew Tang Xuyu was going to recommend actors to them.

"Yes! What? You have someone to recommend?"

"My roommates Qin Yuan and Tian Xinyuan will play the two second male leads, and my other two roommates An Sile and Lin Ziming will play guest roles. What do you think?"

Li Yueyue frowned slightly, rested her chin on her arm, and lowered her head in thought.

“Tian Xinyuan does look like a good fit. We did consider him, but we didn't think he'd act, so we didn't send him an invitation.”

Li Yueyue spread her hands, shrugged, and looked helpless.

Qu Sisi lightly covered her lips with her fingers and chuckled softly.

“Of the three of you, I only know you and Asheng well. I really don't know Tian Xinyuan. I'm not sure if he can kiss a man, or if he can accept it.”

Tang Xuyu chuckled.

“That's not a problem. I guarantee he wouldn't have any trouble accepting kissing a man.”

Li Yueyue and Qu Sisi exchanged a glance, both looking bewildered.

The two asked in unison, "Why?"

"That's because he likes men. Qin Yuan happens to be his type. And Qin Yuan, from what I've observed, is bisexual. You don't need to worry about the other two. They like each other, but haven't made their relationship clear yet; they're still in the ambiguous stage, but it'll be soon."

Li Yueyue and Qu Sisi were completely stunned. They remained speechless for a long time.

"How did you know?"

"Didn't you ask Asheng?"

Qu Sisi shook her head blankly.

“That was three years ago. He got dumped by his junior, and he dragged me and Asheng to a bar to drink. He got drunk and then spilled everything.”

“Oh my god…”

Qu Sisi sat up straight, her gaze unwavering as she looked at Tang Xuyu.

“You… do you also like men?”

Tang Xuyu paused for a few seconds, then smiled and said, “Yes! I like men! But not just any man can stand next to me.”

Tang Xuyu’s smile was wickedly radiant, his entire demeanor completely different from before. Before, he exuded a faint sadness; now, he radiated an untamed, arrogant, and unrestrained aura.

Qu Sisi and Li Yueyue frowned simultaneously, their eyes sharp and wary as they looked at Tang Xuyu.

"Which 'you' is the real you? Can we really trust you?"

Tang Xuyu smiled, turned, and waved to the two of them.

Qu Sisi pondered for a moment.

"Sure enough, Asheng was right. He can't see through Tang Xuyu, but Tang Xuyu is genuinely good to him and Tian Xinyuan. He helps them climb the ladder, supporting each other and illuminating each other's lives."

Li Yueyue stayed by Qu Sisi's side, somewhat worried.

Ding!

Qu Sisi opened her phone and found that Tang Xuyu had sent her a photo of the three of them.

Qu Sisi immediately stood up the moment she saw the people in the photo.

Li Yueyue asked in confusion, "What's wrong?"

Qu Sisi zoomed in on the photo of the three of them and held the phone up to Si Yueyue's face. Li Yueyue stared for a few seconds, then suddenly stood up.

The two looked at each other, both shocked, and exclaimed in unison, "Holy crap! All three of them are incredibly handsome?!"

Qu Sisi said, "Why the hell do we need auditions?! We should just have them do makeup tests and act!"

Li Yueyue said, "Exactly! Holy crap! They're so handsome! With these four, our crew has six handsome guys?!"

Qu Sisi said, "If their acting is all so natural, then our show will be a huge hit when it airs!!"

Li Yueyue said, "Exactly! It'll be a hit overseas!"

Qu Sisi and Li Yueyue remained speechless for a long time. If Si Sheng is elegantly alluring yet wickedly beautiful, then Tian Xinyuan is stunningly cold and captivating. Qin Yuan is simply handsome with a touch of cuteness; it's impossible to find adjectives to describe his looks. His handsomeness is so striking that he and Tian Xinyuan could easily create a fantastical romantic pairing.

The two of them are a perfect match!

An Sile and Lin Ziming are simply a handsome couple; the six of them together are a visual feast!

An Sile and Lin Ziming could totally play those two roles! They seem tailor-made for them!

"Oh my god! Tang Xuyu and [unclear] don't have the same chemistry as the other four!"

"No, no, no! I think Tang and [unclear] do have chemistry. It's just that one has long forgotten what he was like before, and the other has hidden his true self. That's why you think they don't have chemistry!"

Qu Sisi thought for a moment. She seemed to recall Asheng mentioning Tang Xuyu's family before.

His parents apparently had a business marriage, and over time, they developed feelings for each other and had Tang Xuyu.

Later, because his parents weren't around, Tang Xuyu was reportedly verbally abused and bullied by relatives when he was young.

It wasn't until Tang Xuyu became an adult that his parents realized their son was completely different from the person they remembered.

By the time they wanted to make amends, Tang Xuyu no longer needed them.

If she hadn't been so curious and asked, Asheng probably wouldn't have told her.

At the time, she listened and thought it wasn't true. She never imagined that Asheng's story was actually what Tang Xuyu had experienced!

No wonder they were so protective of Tang Xuyu, determined not to let him get hurt in any way.

No wonder they targeted Wen Yanhe so fiercely that day. They wouldn't allow Tang Xuyu to be harmed in the slightest, not even by their own family!
