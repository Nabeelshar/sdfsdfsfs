Chapter 6

"This must be it, right?"

Knock knock! Knock knock!

"Come in!"

Tian Xinyuan scratched his head, somewhat annoyed at how Tang Xuyu had tricked him into coming here!

Just because he said I could find a boyfriend in this drama? Sigh! I was too impulsive!

Tian Xinyuan pushed open the door, looking at the boy with his back to him.

A strange emotion surged through him. He was too nervous to speak.

Qin Yuan turned around, staring at Tian Xinyuan's face, frozen in place.

Tian Xinyuan stammered, "Um, um, hello!"

Qin Yuan smiled and extended his hand, saying, "Hello. I play your wife in this drama!"

Tian Xinyuan, bewildered, reached out and shook hands with Qin Yuan.

"Um, hello! I'm Tian Xinyuan!"

"Qin Yuan."

Tang Xuyu patted Tian Xinyuan's right shoulder from the side.

"Hey! Snap out of it!"

"Ah, oh, oh. Xuyu, why did you call me over?"

Tang Xuyu looked at Tian Xinyuan's innocent eyes, somewhat puzzled.

"You... don't know?"

"What should I know?"

Tang Xuyu pointed at Tian Xinyuan, then at Qin Yuan.

"Of course I'm filming on set! You play the second male lead, and A-Yuan is also the second male lead, and she's your wife."

"Ah...why didn't anyone tell me?!"

Tian Xinyuan suddenly realized that no one had told him he was filming on set!

"Wait a minute! When did I agree to come filming?!"

Tang Xuyu looked at Tian Xinyuan like he was an idiot.

"You coming here means you're not opposed to it, right? I asked you yesterday, and you agreed! You're not thinking of going back on your word, are you?!"

"When did I..."

Tian Xinyuan suddenly remembered that he hadn't heard much of what A-Yuan had said last night after drinking.

He only vaguely remembered something about filming and finding a wife. What exactly had he agreed to?! He couldn't remember anything at all!!

"You didn't go to the bar to drown your sorrows again last night, did you? And when I called, you knew nothing and just casually agreed!"

"No! I, I..."

Tang Xuyu chuckled in exasperation. He said to Qin Yuan, "Your husband's a little dazed right now. Don't worry, he's just offline right now. He wouldn't be this dazed if he weren't. You two should nurture your relationship! I'm going to do my makeup now."

Tang Xuyu waved goodbye to Qin Yuan.

Qin Yuan frowned slightly, not entirely believing Tang Xuyu's words.

Because, Tian Xinyuan really did look incredibly, incredibly dazed right now!

Qin Yuan briefly explained the situation to Tian Xinyuan. Seeing Tian Xinyuan still standing there dumbfounded,

he helplessly covered his face and pulled the dazed Tian Xinyuan away.

He really didn't want to be the butt of the makeup artists' jokes! It was too embarrassing!

He should have known better than to agree to A-Yu's request! For the money, he'd endure it! Once the contract was signed, he'd get the money!

Tian Xinyuan finished his makeup, completely bewildered, and was then pushed off to change clothes, equally bewildered.

After changing, he looked at Qin Yuan's school uniform and suddenly realized what was happening.

This! Isn't that Qing Li's school uniform?! Are we filming high school scenes today?!

Tang Xuyu came out after changing. Tian Xinyuan called out to him.

"Ah Yu! Do you think if we go back to filming, the old man won't drag us to his office to grade his exams?"

Tang Xuyu suddenly remembered that Qingli had a custom: during the crucial transition from junior to senior high school, there were exams at a fixed time.

Today is July 15th?! The day Qingli teachers grade exams!

"I...I forgot. What should we do? I don't want to grade papers!"

Tian Xinyuan was on the verge of tears!

"I don't want to either! We're doomed! The old man definitely knows we're going back!"

Qin Yuan, Shan Shan, and the late-arriving An Sile and Lin Ziming exchanged puzzled glances.

Qin Yuan said, "Ah Yu, you graduated from Qingli?"

"Yes."

An Sile and Lin Ziming exchanged a look.

An Sile said, "The old man you're talking about, could he be the principal of Qingli School?"

Tang Xuyu replied listlessly, "Yes."

"I heard that the principal likes to catch students to grade his papers. And my friend told me that three boys always get caught by the principal to grade papers. You two aren't two of them, are you?!"

"Yeah! That old man, tsk."

Tang Xuyu and Tian Xinyuan exchanged a glance.

"Looks like we need to be prepared for both sides!"

"Yeah!"

Wen Yanhe opened the door and was somewhat stunned to see the people in the room.

The group chatted and laughed as they left the dressing room. Wen Yanhe glanced at them, forced himself to look away, and sat down to begin his makeup.

"Wow! I really didn't expect Tang Xuyu and the guy who played the second male lead to both graduate from Qingli High School! That high school is notoriously hard to get into!"

"Yeah! I heard from my neighbor that his son got in, but the academic pressure is immense! However, the students help each other out. The atmosphere, educational resources, and cafeteria food are among the best of all high schools!"

"Right, right! I know that! My niece used to be afraid to make friends because of a school bully. But since she got in, her smile is so sweet and adorable! She's much more cheerful and lively than before!"

"Haha! Perfect timing to go to Qingli today and see if the environment and food are good! Hahahaha!"

Qingli… back then, he was so close to being free. It's a pity… just that little bit more, maybe he could have met Tang Xuyu sooner. Filming at midday was exhausting, even for an iron man.

Tang Xuyu nearly fainted. Tian Xinyuan was almost the same.

An Sile and Lin Ziming were the most relaxed. They were temporarily acting as managers at a milk tea shop.

Qin Yuan was so tired that she collapsed into Tian Xinyuan's arms, her face flushed.

Tian Xinyuan quickly grabbed an ice pack and placed it on Qin Yuan's forehead and arms, hoping it would make her feel better.

"Don't you think I'm heavy?"

"Not heavy at all."

Wen Yanhe, having finished filming, sat down to rest, also nearly collapsing from exhaustion.

No matter how the four of them filmed, Si Yueyue wasn't satisfied. She discussed it with Qu Sisi.

Ultimately, it turned out that the four of them still lacked a bit of liveliness.

Although the audience wouldn't notice when it aired, Si Yueyue still wanted to make the drama as good and perfect as possible.

The four of them understood somewhat. Filming went a bit better on their second take, capturing a perfect high school life.

It depicted a youthful liveliness amidst repression, finding fun and joy to release the pressure of studying.

"Cut! Great! That's a take! Take a break! You've worked hard!"

Tang Xuyu and Tian Xinyuan stood in the shade, avoiding the sun while drinking iced milk tea to cool down.

"Hehe!"

"Ah Yu, don't you think that voice sounds familiar?"

"It does sound familiar..."

Tang Xuyu and Tian Xinyuan sat listlessly in the office, grading papers while keeping a close eye on the old man.

The old man sat on the sofa, legs crossed, leisurely sipping iced milk tea and eating small cakes. His expression was one of pure enjoyment.

Tian Xinyuan, unable to contain himself any longer, said, "How dare you, old man! You're grading our papers!"

The old man calmly replied, "Of course I'm embarrassed! Why are you embarrassed? You don't have any scenes this afternoon. Hurry up and finish grading, and I'll treat you to dinner, okay?"

Tian Xinyuan and Tang Xuyu's anger subsided a little. They continued grading the papers.

They changed the time several times over, from 11 o'clock to 2 o'clock. Both of their hands and necks were sore and aching.
