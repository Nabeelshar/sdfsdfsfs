Chapter 1

"Ah Yu, that production crew hasn't given up yet?"

Tang Xuyu rubbed his temples, quite helpless.

It all started when he, to help his roommate finish his homework, acted as the school heartthrob in a video.

That day, he didn't even want to talk about it. He had to wear a white shirt and black pants in the sweltering heat. He almost got heatstroke.

It was also because his roommate was so impulsive that he posted it directly on Douyin (TikTok). It instantly went viral.

"Yeah. A BL (Boys' Love) production crew. This crew is really persistent."

Qin Yuan burst into laughter. His ear-piercing, unbearable, hearty laughter echoed throughout the dormitory.

"Ah Yu's going to be acting in a BL drama too! If you ask me, you should just go for it! Haha!"

Tang Xuyu immediately closed his eyes, not wanting to listen to Qin Yuan's rant. He put on his headphones and went to sleep.

For the next week, Tang Xuyu was practically going crazy. This production crew was basically harassing him until he agreed.

Tang Xuyu suffered greatly from this, and could only politely say he could give it a try.

That made him feel a little better.

"Ah Yu! We're leaving now!"

Tang Xuyu packed his things and turned around to say, "Okay!"

After Tang Xuyu finished packing, his phone rang. He thought it was a message from his mother.

But when he opened his phone, it was from the production crew. The gist of it was that he had an audition tomorrow afternoon at 1 PM, and filming would start the day after.

Tang Xuyu let out a deep breath.

He called his mother, telling her he didn't need to come pick him up; the family driver could do it. He also mentioned that he had an audition for a film crew nearby the next afternoon, not far from home.

After showering, Tang Xuyu lay on the bed, looking utterly dejected.

If his brothers knew he was going to act in a BL drama, they would tease him relentlessly for three months.

"Ugh! Annoying."

Even though Tang Xuyu didn't want to, he could only get up, wash, eat lunch, and take a taxi to the audition location.

Tang Xuyu got out of the car, looking at the nearby buildings. He had a bad feeling about this.

Tang Xuyu knocked on the door, referring to the photo the production team had sent him.

Hearing the echo, he pushed open the door and went in.

He was dressed in a white T-shirt, jeans, white sneakers, black-rimmed glasses, and his hair was casually styled.

This outfit made the crew feel as if the protagonist from the book had come to life before them.

The female director had noticed his good looks in photos. But seeing him in person, she realized he wasn't photogenic at all; he was even more handsome in person than in videos.

“Hello. Which scene would you like to audition for?”

Tang Xuyu felt uncomfortable under the stares of everyone in the room. He forced a smile and spoke.

“Oh, okay. Xiao Ning, here’s the script.”

“Okay, Director.”

Tang Xuyu received the script and thanked him softly.

"Ahem!"

The female director cleared her throat and asked, "Have you ever been in a relationship?"

Tang Xuyu paused, his hand still flipping through the script. He wanted to lie, but his good upbringing prevented him from doing so. He told the truth, "No."

The female director smiled.

"You don't need to look at the script. Let's start."

"Huh?"

Tang Xuyu was stunned.

Start what? Start what?

"Director, we have some requirements."

Xiao Ning whispered in the female director's ear.

"I know that. Just a scene where he confesses his love to someone of the opposite sex. Is that okay?"

Tang Xuyu thought for a moment. It shouldn't be a problem. He had seen his father confess to his mother every year, their sweet atmosphere... Sometimes, Tang Xuyu envied his parents' relationship.

"I can."

"Okay, get ready and let's begin."

"Ready."

Tang Xuyu closed his eyes, recalling the scene of his father confessing his love to his mother.

Opening his eyes, Tang Xuyu's eyes visibly brimmed with emotion.

Tang Xuyu lowered his head slightly, shy and nervous, his hands pressed tightly against his trousers.

"I...I like you! Will you be my girlfriend?"

Tang Xuyu was somewhat dejected, forcing a smile, his eyes brimming with tears.

“It’s okay. It’s my business that I like you. You don’t need to feel guilty. Thank you for rejecting me. Be happy!”

The female director stood up excitedly, slamming her hand on the table.

“Excellent! Excellent! You’re the one!”

Tang Xuyu immediately snapped out of his emotions, startled by the sound of the table being slammed.

“What do you think, author?”

The female director turned to the author and the female screenwriter, who had been sitting silently to the side.

“Excellent. He’s the An Qianyi I envisioned. Congratulations on landing the lead role.”

Tang Xuyu bowed in thanks.

“Excuse me, is it convenient for you to stay at a hotel?”

Tang Xuyu shook his head and said, “No, I live nearby. It won’t delay the filming schedule.”

The female director immediately understood Tang Xuyu’s unspoken message. He smiled. He let it be.

The female director informed Tang Xuyu of the filming time and location for tomorrow.

Tang Xuyu nodded.

The next morning, Tang Xuyu was woken by his alarm clock. He reluctantly got out of bed and glanced at his phone.

His phone showed 6:20 AM. The female director had informed him that makeup and hair would start at 7:30 AM.

Tang Xuyu tried to wake himself up, brainwashing himself that filming would earn him money, and with money, he could buy many things.

Tang Xuyu arrived at the location at 7:15 AM. He asked the crew members along the way where makeup and hair were done.

Tang Xuyu opened the door and saw the female director and screenwriter arguing.

Tang Xuyu quietly waited for the two women to finish arguing. The female director glanced out of the corner of her eye and noticed Tang Xuyu had arrived.

“Little Tang’s here!”

“Yeah.”

“Have you had breakfast?”

“Yes, I came over.”

“Oh, little Tang, I forgot to post this last night. I’ll post it now. Join the group now. I’ll transfer your salary to your card first.”

“Okay.”

Tang Xuyu sat obediently in the chair, letting the makeup artist do whatever she wanted with his hair and face.

The makeup artist absolutely loved actors who sat quietly, without saying a word, and whose eyes didn’t wander. She simply adored it!

“All done.”

“Thank you.”

“It’s nothing, it’s nothing.”

By the time they started filming Tang Xuyu’s scenes, it was already 3 PM.

Tang Xuyu received a message on his phone that the milk tea truck had arrived. He told the female director he was going out for a bit.

The female director readily agreed.

Tang Xuyu returned quickly, followed by the crew. The crew members' eyes widened in surprise.

“Put it here.”

The female director was somewhat shocked, her voice weak as she asked, “Little Tang, what is this…?”

“I saw everyone had been filming all morning and afternoon, so I had them make some milk tea and small cakes and bring them over.”

“Oh, okay.”

The sign on the truck was instantly recognizable to anyone in the entertainment industry; this shop was famous for its delicious milk tea and small cakes, though a bit pricey. However, it was worth it if you gritted your teeth and tried it once in a while.

If the female director remembered correctly, this shop didn't deliver.

The female director, somewhat dazed, took a sip of her milk tea. She felt a little guilty towards Xiao Tang. She'd only given him the crew's standard boxed lunch at noon. Xiao Tang hadn't said a word, eating like a little hamster.

She'd left him hanging for so long, and the female director also felt a little guilty towards him.

She easily lost track of time when she was busy, and Xiao Tang had waited patiently without a single complaint.

"Young Master, welcome back next time."

"Yes. I posted the compensation in the group chat, please collect it."

"Okay."

After all the staff had left, the crew members were still in a daze.
