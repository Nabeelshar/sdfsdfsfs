Chapter 4

"Yes, how could I forget the promise An Qianyi made to Su Yu? How could he question his lover over such a small matter, without listening to her explanation?"

Qu Sisi suddenly understood. Why did she give An Qianyi those lines in the first place? When An Qianyi vented his anger on his lover, wasn't he also helpless?

Because he couldn't escape the plot of the book, so…

If the world in the book is cyclical, did he resent his own powerlessness, his inability to resist the plot?

Li Yueyue and Qu Sisi were on the same page. They discussed how to revise this section.

Tang Xuyu sat quietly to the side, fanning himself and looking at the script.

As darkness fell, the freshly printed script was delivered to Tang Xuyu.

The moment Tang Xuyu saw the lines, his face flushed crimson.

Wen Yanhe, looking at the lines, felt his toes digging into the ground. He simply couldn't bring himself to say those embarrassing lines!

"Alright! Everyone, get ready, get ready, action!"

Tang Xuyu composed himself, drawing the character from his heart, letting the role resonate with him.

"Do you believe me?"

Su Yu looked at her lover with teary eyes and a glimmer of hope, hoping he would believe her.

An Qianyi gently stroked Su Yu's hair, smiling as he comforted her, "Of course I believe you. But I hope you can try to see things from my perspective and have some compassion for me. Is that okay?"

A tear fell onto the back of Su Yu's hand, the scalding liquid making him feel somewhat lost.

At that moment, he realized he had indeed neglected his lover too much, taking out his frustrations on her whenever things didn't go his way, and she had repeatedly forgiven him.

"Ah Yi, I will! I will! I know I was wrong! I really know I was wrong!"

An Qianyi comforted Su Yu as always.

“Let’s go back, it’s getting late.”

“Okay!”

Su Yu wiped away her tears, grabbed An Qianyi’s hand as he turned away, and tiptoed to kiss him.

An Qianyi’s shock was genuine.

What’s going on?! This wasn’t in the script! What’s wrong with Wen Yanhe?! He added this unexpected action?!

“Ayi, I love you, all of me belongs to you.”

“Cut!”

Tang Xuyu was still reeling from the forced kiss, his eyes slightly glazed.

“Director, this line isn’t in the script. I need an explanation!”

Li Yueyue suddenly remembered that the script she gave them had a source.

It's no wonder Tang Xuyu asked her. She tends to forget things when she's filming. She probably forgot to tell Tang Xuyu that their scripts were different.

"Sorry, sorry. I forgot to tell you, your script is a little different from [the director's]."

Tang Xuyu was caught in a dilemma, unsure whether to be angry or not. The director had already apologized; it wasn't in his nature to hold a grudge. He had no choice but to swallow his anger.

Wen Yanhe sat to the side, calmly studying the script.

"[Director's Name], may I speak to you privately?"

"Sure."

Qu Sisi led Wen Yanhe to a pavilion, from which the film crew could be seen.

"I think you already know about Tang Xuyu's background, right?"

"Yes."

Qu Sisi gently covered her lips with her fingers, smiling softly.

“These past few days, I’ve noticed that Tang Xuyu isn’t at all averse to your physical touch. And you’re the first person who’s been around Tang Xuyu for so long.”

Wen Yanhe didn’t quite understand.

“The first? What do you mean?”

“Do you like him?”

“Yes, I like him a lot.”

“Asheng told me that Tang Xuyu would never allow any guy to stay by his side. Tang Xuyu knows you like him, but he tacitly approves of and allows you to get close to him. Do you understand what I mean?”

Wen Yanhe was quite surprised. To be precise, surprised.

“Isn’t he straight?”

Qu Sisi silently shook her head.

“Perhaps not for you. Maybe he hasn't realized his own feelings yet. That dinner party was the first time I saw it… Later, Asheng told me that if Tang Xuyu really wanted to punish someone, that person's fate would be dismemberment and fed to wolves or dumped in private waters to feed his sharks.”

Wen Yanhe lowered his eyes, his gaze shifting.

“You saw it?”

“Yes. I saw it, a couple of days ago. Asheng showed me a video; Tang Xuyu in the video was actually quite terrifying.”

“Let me think about it.”

Qu Sisi smiled, turned, and left, giving Wen Yanhe time to consider.

The scene was finally over. Tang Xuyu smacked his neck, as if that made him feel better.

"Um, can I stay at your place?"

Tang Xuyu's hand, which was clenched in a fist, paused. He turned and looked at Wen Yanhe with a puzzled expression.

"You mean, come home and stay with me?"

"Yes."

"Are you out of your mind?"

"..."

Sometimes Wen Yanhe really wanted to sew Tang Xuyu's mouth shut.

He was so gentle and soft-spoken with everyone else, but with him, he was such a straight-laced guy!

Li Yueyue reacted quickly and immediately spoke up for Wen Yanhe.

"□□ is right! It'll be good for filming later if you two stay in the same room!"

Tang Xuyu looked at Si Yueyue with a "Are you alright?" expression.

"W-what's wrong?! Living together is one thing?! What's wrong?!"

Tang Xuyu looked at Wen Yanhe and relented, saying, "Pack your things. Come back with me tonight."

"Okay."

Wen Yanhe dragged his suitcase and followed Tang Xuyu out of the filming location.

"Young Master."

"Hmm."

The butler took Wen Yanhe's suitcase, opened the trunk, and put it inside.

Wen Yanhe stared at the luxury car in disbelief. He hadn't looked closely because he'd been drugged last time, but now, Tang Xuyu was clearly a very wealthy young master!

He'd checked three days ago, but aside from where he went to school, there was no family information. Then, remembering that family and those two people, he immediately understood.

Tang Xuyu opened the door, looking somewhat bewildered.

He glanced at the door, then at the house. Uncertainty.

“Ayu, move aside! I want to see my daughter-in-law!”

Tang Xuyu was pushed aside by his mother.

“Daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law…”

Tang's mother's bright smile froze.

“A man, a man?”

Tang's mother turned to look at Tang Xuyu, her face filled with shock.

“Ayu, you like men?”

Tang Xuyu rubbed his temples.

“Mom, he's my colleague. Not my boyfriend.”

“Oh, oh, oh.”

Tang's mother straightened her appearance, striking a perfectly appropriate smile.

"I'm so sorry, you must have seen something funny. What's your name?"

"Hello, Auntie, my name is Wen Yanhe."

"Oh, Wen Yanhe. Wen... Wen Yanhe?!"

Mother Tang looked at Wen Yanhe in disbelief, then turned and quickly pulled Father Tang, who was sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper, to the door.

Father Tang stared at Wen Yanhe, his mouth agape in astonishment.

"Wen, □□?!"

Wen Yanhe smiled gently.

"Hello, Uncle. I'm sorry to bother you."

"No, no, no!"

Mother Tang echoed, "Yes, no, no! Please, please come in."

Wen Yanhe carried his suitcase inside.

The two men's eyes met, and Wen Yanhe was the first to give in, his eyes darting around.
