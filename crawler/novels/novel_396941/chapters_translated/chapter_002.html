Chapter 2

“Little Tang.”

Tang Xuyu turned to the director.

The director grinned and said, “Your boyfriend’s here. I’m so sorry to have kept you waiting so long. Their assistant made a mistake, causing them to miss their flight. I’m really sorry!”

Tang Xuyu shook his head, indicating it was alright.

“Alright, alright, get ready to film!”

The director looked at Tang Xuyu with a beaming smile.

“Do you know which part we’re filming?”

Tang Xuyu didn’t react at first, but seeing the director’s cheeky smile, he suddenly remembered that they were filming a kissing scene.

Tang Xuyu’s face flushed bright red.

The director smiled. He patted Tang Xuyu’s shoulder reassuringly.

"It's alright, it's alright. Kissing scenes are all practiced slowly like this. Little Tang! Keep a calm mind, keep a calm mind!"

Tang Xuyu didn't even see what the other lead actor looked like until filming began.

A gentle and refined demeanor, a delicate face, and a perfectly proportioned inverted triangle physique.

Tang Xuyu couldn't believe that someone with such a great physique would play the submissive role.

"Action."

Tang Xuyu immediately got into character. The first half was perfect, but when it came to the kiss, no matter how much he tried to convince himself, he just couldn't bring himself to do it.

Wen Yanhe noticed the boy's struggle and, using a visual illusion, took the initiative to kiss him.

The moment their lips touched, Tang Xuyu's eyes widened instantly.

The director yelled "Cut!", but he still hadn't fully recovered.

The director, somewhat flustered, said, "Xiao Tang, that wasn't your first kiss, was it?"

Wen Yanhe, standing next to Tang Xuyu, paused in his drinking.

"Yes."

The director was now in a dilemma.

"This…"

She should have realized that a boy who had never been in a relationship probably hadn't given away his first kiss.

She was too excited yesterday and forgot to ask.

She should have waited until Xiao Tang was ready before filming this scene.

Wen Yanhe opened his mouth, unsure how to comfort the boy who had just lost his first kiss.

He really hadn't expected that the other lead actor the director had chosen would be a university student.

This was what the director had told him when he finished filming today and was packing up to return to the hotel.

Wen Yanhe looked out the window at the receding scenery.

No wonder he's so young, he's a college student. Could he have been tricked into coming here?

With her methods, it's quite possible.

Wen Yanhe sighed, somewhat at a loss.

"Tsk. A college student...this is a bit tricky..."

After spending the entire night trying to calm himself down, Tang Xuyu finally composed himself. It wasn't appropriate to tell his parents about this.

The scenes filmed this morning went smoothly. The acting of the two leads was completely worry-free for the director.

Tang Xuyu asked the director for some ice packs and stuck them on his forehead, hands, and thighs.

His face was flushed from the heat, and Tang Xuyu regretted taking this role many times.

"Little Tang, are you alright?"

"Not bad. I can still keep up with the director."

"Good. You take a rest, I'll go film the other people's scenes."

"Okay."

Tang Xuyu closed his eyes, taking a moment to recover.

"Hahaha! I knew you wouldn't come out these past two days. So you've been filming here?! Haha!"

Tang Xuyu didn't even need to think; it was definitely his buddy.

"Hey Xuyu! When did you start liking guys? Why didn't you tell us?!"

Tang Xuyu angrily threw the ice pack on his forehead at the two of them.

"Hey! Hey! Hey! Are we even brothers anymore?! Murder?!"

Tang Xuyu sat up, opening his eyes. He looked at the two grinning smugly in front of him.

"How did you know I was here?"

The two men sat down without any ceremony, flanking Tang Xuyu.

They leisurely enjoyed the large fan on set.

"My girlfriend told me! She said she'd found her An Qianyi. She even sent me a picture. I looked, and oh my! Isn't that our Tang Xuyu, the young master Tang?! Haha! Seriously, if we weren't so familiar with you, no one else would recognize you with that hairstyle that hides your good looks!"

"Yeah! I didn't believe it when Asheng told me, but after seeing the picture, I believed it! So, we came to visit you on set today! Isn't that thoughtful?"

Tang Xuyu was utterly dejected.

"When did you start dating? Why didn't you tell me?"

Si Sheng paused for a second.

"Didn't I tell you?"

Tang Xuyu glanced at him speechlessly.

"No. You've been keeping it a secret from me pretty well!"

Si Sheng smiled awkwardly. He shifted his gaze and said, "Haha! Really? Haha!"

"Alright, that's enough. The director's calling me."

Tang Xuyu stood up, turned to the two of them, and warned, "If my parents find out, you two are dead!"

The two gave each other an OK sign in unison.

Tang Xuyu wasn't very comfortable; he didn't like being pressured.

He forced himself to finish filming the scene.

Tang Xuyu quickly went to the bathroom and washed his hands repeatedly.

Si Sheng and Tian Xinyuan, seeing Tang Xuyu's expression, knew they had guessed correctly.

No matter how much time passed, Tang Xuyu was annoyed by being pressed down. The two guessed that if it weren't for filming, the other lead actor would be lying in a VIP hospital room right now.

At least for now, he was just giving them the cold shoulder.

Wen Yanhe was talking to his assistant when he caught a glimpse of Tang Xuyu's cold expression out of the corner of his eye, and was somewhat bewildered.

"Tang Xuyu, do you not like being touched?"

The assistant thought for a moment.

"No! The director didn't say that Teacher Tang Xuyu doesn't like being touched."

"Is that so?"

"Yes!"

Wen Yanhe looked at the three chatting and laughing, his doubts deepening.

He knew the brand Tang Xuyu was wearing—a very affordable small brand. He could immediately tell at a glance that the two people next to him were wearing custom-made clothes.

Wen Yanhe couldn't fathom how Tang Xuyu knew those two. Even his father might not be able to easily meet them.

Although Tang Xuyu's face matched his ideal type, he knew Tang Xuyu was straight after filming for the past two days.

There was no way they could be together. He had to keep that flutter in his heart.

“Screenwriter?”

Qu Sisi paused, then walked to Si Sheng's side.

“You know Tang Xuyu?”

“Yes. He's the Tang Xuyu I told you about, the future head of the family. We've known each other since we were kids, for eighteen years. He's a really nice person.”

Qu Sisi smiled gently.

“Hello, I'm Si Sheng's girlfriend, Qu Sisi.”

“Tang Xuyu.”

That's it, they were now acquainted.

The four chatted for a long time. Even after Wen Yanhe finished filming his scenes for the day, they were still talking.

Wen Yanhe looked thoughtfully towards Tang Xuyu. Tang Xuyu turned his head and noticed Wen Yanhe.

Tang Xuyu frowned. He saw the possessive look in Wen Yanhe's eyes. Even if Tang Xuyu was slow to realize, he understood now: Wen Yanhe liked him.

Tang Xuyu looked at Qu Sisi.

"Wen Yanhe likes men?"

Qu Sisi was taken aback. She thought for a few seconds.

"It seems so. A year ago, his rival exposed it; he admitted in an interview that he liked men. Why?"

Si Sheng and Tian Xinyuan immediately understood the implication of Tang Xuyu's words.

Si Sheng glanced in Wen Yanhe's direction, a sarcastic smile playing on his lips.

"Ayu really hates possessive looks from men."

Tian Xinyuan also looked in Wen Yanhe's direction. He spoke up, "Ayu was pursued by a bottom in the gay community before. Ayu rejected him many times, but the bottom wouldn't listen. It seriously affected Ayu's ability to make friends. Ayu was drugged by that person and almost… I never expected Wen Yanhe to actually like Ayu."

Qu Sisi was somewhat stunned. She also looked in Wen Yanhe's direction.

"Asheng, why didn't you tell me?"

"That was two years ago. We're in different circles, so I didn't tell you. I never imagined there would be people from that circle in the entertainment industry."

"Asheng. Wen Yanhe was, after all, persuaded by Yueyue. He's a movie star, his acting is excellent. If his role is vacant, perhaps no one can handle the role of the 'shou' in my book."

Si Sheng knew how much effort Qu Sisi had put into getting the lead role.

"I know."
