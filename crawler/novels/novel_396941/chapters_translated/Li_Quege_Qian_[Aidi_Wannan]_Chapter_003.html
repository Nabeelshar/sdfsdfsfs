Chapter 3

"Thank you, President Si and President Tian, for investing in our 'Reckless' production team. I'll drink this first as a sign of respect!"

Si Sheng smiled insincerely, his eyes fixed on Wen Yanhe, who was quietly eating his meal.

He simply couldn't believe that Li Yueyue hadn't arranged the seating. She had actually placed Wen Yanhe to Tang Xuyu's right.

Throughout the meal, Si Sheng and Tian Xinyuan kept pouring drinks for Wen Yanhe. After a while, the crew members realized that Wen Yanhe had offended Si Sheng and Tian Xinyuan.

The assistant was frantic. She quickly broke down trying to stop him.

"Brother Wen really can't drink anymore! He really can't drink anymore! Please, President Si and President Tian, have mercy on Brother Wen!"

The young woman was crying her eyes out. Everyone else felt a pang of sympathy.

Li Yueyue stood up, ready to speak.

"Screenwriter, didn't you have something to say to the director?"

Qu Sisi knew that Tang Xuyu wanted Wen Yanhe to drink until he felt nauseous and never wanted to drink again.

She wanted to stop him, but didn't want to offend the Tang family. She could only grab Li Yueyue and forcibly pull her away.

Si Sheng and Tian Xinyuan looked at Tang Xuyu.

"Even your brother Wen hasn't said anything. Do you, a mere assistant, have the right to speak before your master?"

Tang Xuyu lazily raised his eyelids, his eyes filled with a ruthless intensity that made the young girl's legs go weak, and tears welled up in her eyes.

Wen Yanhe's body stiffened for a moment.

Si Sheng and Tian Xinyuan both obeyed Tang Xuyu, indicating that Tang Xuyu held the dominant position among the three.

The fact that Tang Xuyu didn't stop them from pouring him so much wine suggests that he tacitly approved of their actions.

"I didn't say stop, so keep drinking."

Si Sheng smiled and refilled Wen Yanhe's glass.

"Drinking like this is pointless."

Tian Xinyuan, in full view of everyone, placed a poisoned wine into Wen Yanhe's glass.

Wen Yanhe's face was deathly pale, his lips devoid of color. His hand holding the glass trembled slightly.

"Drink! Poison!"

Wen Yanhe swallowed the poisoned wine without leaving a drop. Si Sheng and Tian Xinyuan smiled sarcastically. He turned and, without missing a single person from the gathering, made an excuse to send them all back to their hotel. Even Wen Yanhe's assistant was escorted away by bodyguards.

"Ayu, we'll be leaving now."

"Okay."

Tang Xuyu finished eating, wiped his mouth, stood up, and walked to Wen Yanhe's right side.

"Wen Yanhe, [someone's name], [something unclear]. Put away your shameful thoughts."

Wen Yanhe silently shed tears.

"Where are you staying? I'll take you home."

"Thank you."

Tang Xuyu opened the back door of the car for Wen Yanhe to get in, then stepped inside himself.

Tang Xuyu turned his head to look at the scenery outside the window, his thoughts drifting into the distance.

Wen Yanhe couldn't forcefully suppress the surging effects of the drug. He bit his lip tightly, tears streaming silently down his face.

"Look up."

Wen Yanhe was lost in his own world, oblivious to the outside world.

"Wen Yanhe?"

Tang Xuyu abruptly lifted Wen Yanhe's chin, staring at the sobbing Wen Yanhe, stunned.

"Wen Yanhe? Wen Yanhe? Can you hear me?!"

"Don't bite your lip! Wen Yanhe! Let go of your teeth!"

Tang Xuyu held out his finger, trying to stop Wen Yanhe from biting his lip. The wound on his lip shocked Tang Xuyu.

"Wen Yanhe! Wake up! Wake up!"

Tang Xuyu regretted it. He hadn't expected Wen Yanhe to become like this.

Tang Xuyu grabbed Wen Yanhe's chin and skillfully forced his lips open, stuffing the medicine into Wen Yanhe's mouth.

Tang Xuyu wanted Wen Yanhe to swallow water to take the medicine down his throat.

Tang Xuyu watched the water slide down his chin. He knew this couldn't continue.

He poured water into Wen Yanhe's mouth, gripped his chin tightly, and pressed their lips together. Wen Yanhe unconsciously began to swallow the water.

Fortunately, the medicine was finally swallowed.

The next day, Wen Yanhe woke up, looking blankly at the room's furnishings.

Luxurious yet simple. Something the Wen family could never afford in their lifetime. Class was something they couldn't change, no matter how hard they climbed.

The moment Wen Yanhe saw Tang Xuyu, he recalled what had happened in the car the previous night.

Wen Yanhe buried his feelings for Tang Xuyu deep in his heart.

Li Yueyue learned from Qu Sisi that Tang Xuyu's identity was far from simple. Although the Si family was an upper-class family, there was an insurmountable gap between them and the Tang family.

Li Yueyue had to admit that the Tang family was a family they could only look up to.

Li Yueyue arrived at the film set early the next morning and learned from the staff what had happened after she left the previous night.

She was very worried about Wen Yanhe. If Tang Xuyu was indeed a member of the Tang family, the eldest son of the Tang family, then Wen Yanhe was practically flirting with death.

Everyone knew that Tang Dashao hated seeing possessiveness in a man's eyes.

"□□!"

Li Yueyue looked at Wen Yanhe, tears streaming down her face.

"Director, I'm fine. I can start filming after a short rest. I promise it won't delay the crew's schedule."

Wen Yanhe forced a pale smile to reassure the director.

"Alright. Your scenes aren't urgent. You can film once you've rested."

Li Yueyue looked at Wen Yanhe's pale face, unsure whether to feel happy or cry.

"Okay."

Tang Xuyu arrived at the film set. He ignored the crew members' frightened expressions.

After getting his makeup done, he began filming his scenes for the day. There were quite a few; hopefully, he wouldn't get heatstroke.

After filming half of his scenes, Tang Xuyu collapsed onto a folding chair, his head and arms covered in ice packs to cool him down.

"□□□ is treating everyone to milk tea! And chilled mung bean soup to beat the heat!"

The crew rushed over, thanking □□□ for the treats.

Tang Xuyu remained in the chair, eyes closed, resting.

When it was time to film his scenes, he removed the ice packs so the makeup artist could touch up his makeup. Then, a new round of filming began.

Filming finished at 9 PM. He said goodbye to the director and screenwriter, left the set, and went home to rest in bed.

After a week of intense filming, Tang Xuyu felt like he was half-dead. Although he's naturally tan-resistant, he can't withstand this kind of daily sun exposure.

This scene was filmed by the lake. Tang Xuyu removed the ice pack and took out a fan and script from his bag. He stood silently to the side, reciting his lines while the fan blew at full blast.

For the two days since learning Tang Xuyu's identity, Li Yueyue had been worried that he might take the opportunity to retaliate against her.

In the end, she realized that Tang Xuyu was still the same as before. A little weight lifted from her heart.

After all, he was treating the crew to good food every few days, so it wasn't good to be awkward anymore.

"Crack! Crack! Tang Xuyu, you should be questioning Wen Yanhe with a heartbroken and distressed expression, not worrying about him with a look of adoring resoluteness!"

Li Yueyue felt that perhaps things had gone too smoothly during filming before, and now fate was deliberately working against her!

Tang Xuyu thought the line was illogical and started arguing with the director, with Qu Sisi joining the debate.

Tang Xuyu felt this was how the scene should be acted, while Qu Sisi and Si Yueyue insisted it shouldn't be.

But Tang Xuyu's decisive line left them speechless.

“They’ve been dating for a month, and have known each other for half a year. I don’t believe he doesn’t know what his partner’s personality is like. To question his partner over a small misunderstanding is completely unreasonable! Utterly unreasonable!”

“Then tell me what’s unreasonable about it! Be precise!”

“Exactly!”

“First, after knowing each other for so long, he was deeply moved by his partner’s gentleness and her considerate and polite manners towards strangers.” He secretly harbored feelings for her. Secondly, he already knew very well what his lover's family was like. I don't think he would be blinded by anger and lose control, venting his emotions on his lover. Thirdly, the two of them had done all sorts of ambiguous things between lovers during their acquaintance; it's impossible for them to stop believing each other's words after only a month together. I don't believe he would forget the promise he made to his lover.”

Li Yueyue and Qu Sisi were stunned by what they heard. Wen Yanhe was also stunned.

He had long noticed that Tang Xuyu had excellent upbringing; he respected others and had a natural talent for acting.

He truly didn't know that Tang Xuyu would understand the character so thoroughly and accurately. He even questioned the scriptwriter's lines, striving to capture the unique charm of the character.
