Chapter 1 Inch by inch, slowly and deliberately.

The blinding light illuminated the marble countertop, where a young man sat.

Shen Kongyin wiped the remaining water droplets from his hands and tidied his slightly disheveled hair.

He didn't linger long; following the corridor, he quickly found the private room he had just left.

The moment he pushed open the door, a wave of smoke mixed with women's perfume assaulted his nostrils, filling them again. Shen Kongyin frowned, but still chose to go inside.

Inside were young people, drinking and chatting, completely unaware that someone had entered, continuing their previous conversation.

"He's not here, Brother Shen. Tell me, what's your new illegitimate son like?"

The speaker was the young master of the Xu family, with dyed pink hair, downing a bottle of whiskey.

"You're well-informed."

Shen Liangyuan, with a cigarette dangling from his lips, lit it with a lighter, his tone slightly disdainful: "What can he be? He's from the countryside, very honest."

At this, everyone immediately perked up.

"Honest? You don't bully him, do you?"

"Is he good-looking? I heard he's the ninth child, is he particularly young?"

"..."

Immersed in their conversation, the group didn't realize that the person they were discussing was right here.

Shen Kongyin's gaze calmly swept over everyone present, finally settling on Shen Liangyuan. "Illegitimate child."

He savored the word, a playful smile appearing on his face, though it was unclear in the darkness. Then, he lightly kicked the aluminum can beneath his foot.

"Crack—"

The sound of metal clashing against tile was distinct and heard by many. All eyes instantly turned to him, including Shen Liangyuan's.

"What are you doing? Can't you be quiet for a moment?"

Shen Kongyin sat alone on the sofa. Unlike the others surrounded by friends, the boy had only a cold cup of tea in front of him, looking utterly alone and forlorn.

He looked at Shen Liangyuan and coldly scoffed, "What, I want to join in too? Is that not allowed?"

The whispers were so loud; pretending to be deaf was unrealistic.

Shen Liangyuan, feeling humiliated, wanted to regain his composure and impatiently said, "Who gave you the right to speak?"

Descendants of prestigious families typically maintain their own circles and rarely accept outsiders.

Shen Kongyin had only recently been found, and as an illegitimate child with an awkward status, he was naturally ostracized.

Fortunately, Shen Kongyin was too lazy to continue arguing: "Since Fourth Brother says so, then I'll head back first."

Shen Liangyuan always disliked being addressed like that, and upon hearing this, his face turned ashen. "Don't leave!"

He had brought Shen Kongyin along for fun; now that he was gone, how could he explain it to everyone?

The only response was the boy standing up.

Shen Kongyin remained silent, walking into the spotlight and glancing casually at Shen Liangyuan.

Before Shen Liangyuan could react, a sudden voice rang out from inside the private room.

"...He's really handsome."

The speaker was none other than the young master of the Xu family. His eyes were fixed on Shen Kongyin, and he quietly nudged his friend's arm.

After the young master Xu finished speaking, silence fell.

No one refuted him, because Shen Kongyin was indeed very handsome.

The lighting in the private room was quite dim, and he had been sitting in the corner, almost unnoticed.

Only when he appeared did they realize that the illegitimate son the Shen family had finally found was truly handsome.

Even the harshest overhead light, shining on him, only enhanced his already striking features, making them appear even more defined.

His eyebrows and eyes were exquisite, his frame well-proportioned, and the light on his porcelain-white skin seemed to glaze it, making his unique charisma undeniable even in a simple white shirt.

Shen Kongyin, of course, heard this remark. He acted as if it were commonplace, smiling slightly, and even had time to reply to Young Master Xu.

"Thank you."

That glance almost made Young Master Xu embarrassed. He scratched his head, thought for a moment, and said, "Well, I was just talking nonsense before. I didn't mean to look down on you."

Shen Kongyin nodded again, "I know."

Humans are visual creatures. From childhood to adulthood, he had experienced many things like this.

After saying that, he continued walking, showing no respect to Shen Liangyuan.

Seeing that he was truly unafraid of his threats, Shen Liangyuan didn't even think twice, didn't even say goodbye, grabbed the car keys from the table, and followed Shen Kongyin away.

With the two of them gone, the remaining people had a new topic of conversation.

"The Shen family is almost bankrupt, how come he's still so arrogant? Didn't Shen Liangyuan's father inform them properly?"

"They're doing fine now, aren't they? Bankruptcy is a long way off."

"That's true, Cheng Xuelian's reforms can't threaten us. The Shen family company is special; I heard they've been making some big moves lately."

They were all a bunch of good-for-nothing playboys. The conversation was serious for less than two seconds before quickly shifting to other topics.

"But that illegitimate child is really handsome. Did any of you take any pictures...?"

Shen Kongyin naturally didn't hear the commotion. He strolled leisurely down the corridor, waiting for Shen Liangyuan's arrival.

"Shen Kongyin, what's wrong with you!"

Shen Liangyuan quickly found him, followed by a barrage of questions.

Shen Kongyin was too lazy to answer him: "Are we going or not?"

He was sleepy and didn't have time to play games with this young master anymore.

Shen Liangyuan could only toss him the keys: "You haven't been drinking, go drive me."

Shen Kongyin weighed the diamond-encrusted car keys in his hand, raised an eyebrow slightly, and remained silent.

The bar was quite spacious, with winding corridors. Shen Liangyuan walked ahead, and Shen Kongyin followed slowly behind, his pace regular and his posture relaxed.

They were walking peacefully when Shen Liangyuan suddenly stopped, forcing Shen Kongyin to halt as well.

The loud music seemed to dim for a moment. The young man looked up and saw a tall, upright figure walking towards them from the end of the corridor.

The man, dressed in a well-tailored suit, stood like an invisible barrier, isolating himself from the outside world. Several laughing men and women, upon seeing him, instinctively moved aside, making way for him.

He was on the phone, walking at a leisurely pace, perfectly in sync with the music.

Shen Kongyin watched for a while, then suddenly felt the man looked familiar.

Where had she seen him before…?

Before she could remember, Shen Liangyuan beside her moved first. His usual arrogance vanished instantly, and he straightened his back almost reflexively.

At the same time, a cautious yet ingratiating smile appeared on his face: “President Cheng, what a coincidence! I didn’t expect to run into you here!”

The instant Shen Liangyuan uttered those words, Shen Kongyin also instantly remembered where she had seen him before.

In the latest newspapers in Beijing.

The Shen family still maintains the habit of subscribing to newspapers, and during meals, one name often comes up in Shen Zhengxian's head—Cheng Xuelian.

The head of the Feixun Group, the newly appointed patriarch of the Cheng family.

Unexpectedly, I'd see her here…

Upon hearing Shen Liangyuan's greeting, the man paused, made a few words into his phone, hung up, and then looked up, his gaze lingering on him for a moment.

"Young Master Shen."

His voice was low, revealing neither joy nor anger.

But those three words made Shen Liangyuan appear more than twice as excited.

He started talking incessantly about company matters, as if he had gained some great advantage.

A bar was clearly not a good place, and discussing these things wasn't appropriate.

Even so, Cheng Xuelian chose to listen.

Shen Kongyin stood still, quietly waiting for the two to finish.

Perhaps three to five seconds, or perhaps more than a minute, passed. He suddenly felt an extremely penetrating gaze, almost tangible in its warmth, imprinted on his face.

Inch by inch, slowly and deliberately.

A shiver ran down Shen Kongyin's neck, as if he were being targeted by a predator. He abruptly looked up, precisely catching the source of the gaze.

It was that man.

Although Ms. Cheng was listening to Shen Liangyuan's flattery, her gaze, passing over Shen Liangyuan's shoulder, calmly and unabashedly fell upon him.

Danger.

This was Shen Kongyin's first thought.

Locked by this gaze, Shen Kongyin could feel the hairs on his body standing on end, his throat dry.

He almost lost control of his composure, and couldn't even be sure why Cheng Xuelian was looking at him.

Fortunately, three seconds later, Cheng Xuelian subtly looked away, leaving Shen Kongyin alone with his heart pounding wildly.

"Speaking of which, this gentleman is…"

As if only just noticing his presence, Cheng Xuelian casually mentioned him before ending the conversation.

“Him?”

Shen Liangyuan was somewhat embarrassed, unsure how to introduce Shen Kongyin.

The term “illegitimate child” was best left unsaid in private; he couldn't bring himself to give a detailed introduction.

So he raised his voice and shouted towards the corner, “President Cheng is asking you a question!”

Shen Kongyin, unfazed by the rebuke, took two steps forward and briefly introduced himself, his voice soft, “I am Shen Kongyin.”

Cheng Xuelian simply raised an eyebrow, saying nothing more.

Shen Liangyuan, however, couldn't hold back any longer. He angrily stepped forward and grabbed Shen Kongyin's collar, saying, “Can't you speak properly?”

Given the Shen family's current influence, they couldn't afford to offend Cheng Xuelian.

A hint of impatience flashed in Shen Kongyin's eyes, but he quickly suppressed it: "Let go."

He was referring to his collar.

As Shen Liangyuan reprimanded him, Cheng Xuelian's gaze seemingly casually swept over Shen Kongyin's right hand, hanging at his side.

His fist was clenched tightly, the muscles in his thin arm instantly tensing into sharp lines, before he quickly forced himself to relax them one by one, returning to his normal state.

Cheng Xuelian's lips twitched almost imperceptibly. How could he not see that this was the movement of someone about to throw a punch?

The newly found illegitimate son, yet his attitude showed no sign of weakness; quite interesting.

Under that kind of gaze, Shen Liangyuan suddenly felt a pang of guilt.

He reluctantly released her hand, still unsatisfied, and opened his mouth, seemingly wanting to continue his cursing.

At the crucial moment, Cheng Xuelian, who had been watching the drama unfold for a while, spoke up to stop the farce.

"Madam Shen has worked hard all these years to produce offspring for the family."

Upon hearing this, Shen Kongyin lowered her head, unable to hide the smile in her eyes.

Shen Zhengxian had been a womanizer in his youth, and had taken in many children over the years; he even had an older sister.

Cheng Xuelian, of course, recognized Shen Kongyin's identity, but she cleverly distorted the truth, praising Madam Shen's prolific bearing.

A simple sentence, yet carrying a blatant sarcasm. Shen Kongyin silently stepped aside, preparing to observe Shen Liangyuan's reaction.

The latter's face naturally turned pale, then red, then pale again, finally gritting his teeth and admitting, "Haha, President Cheng is right."

He could still smile even after being humiliated.

Shen Kongyin truly hadn't expected this. Shen Liangyuan, usually so arrogant, was suddenly acting so timidly; it was somewhat unusual.

But there was another unexpected turn of events…

Shen Kongyin looked up at Cheng Xuelian, and at the same time, as if pre-arranged, the man also turned his head, his eyes deep and unfathomable. Their eyes met, neither looking away first.

A pair of doe-like, moist eyes blinked rapidly at the other person.

Just like in a movie, Shen Kongyin looked at Cheng Xuelian, her gratitude unmistakable.

The latter smiled but remained silent, lingering a meaningful gaze on Shen Kongyin's face for a moment before walking away.

She didn't say another word to Shen Kongyin.

As the sound of leather shoes clattering on the tiles faded into the distance, Shen Liangyuan immediately reverted to his previous arrogant demeanor.

His attitude was haughty, a far cry from his previous fawning: "Don't tell anyone about what just happened."

Shen Kongyin hadn't originally planned to speak, but seeing his reaction piqued her interest.

He feigned curiosity: "Fourth Brother, can I ask who that person was?"

Shen Liangyuan got goosebumps from being called "Fourth Brother."

"I told you not to call me that. It's something low-class, you wouldn't know even if I told you..."

Without explaining the person's background to Shen Kongyin, the two continued walking out. Shen Liangyuan pulled out his phone and eagerly started complaining to his friends.

"You have no idea who I just ran into, Cheng Xuelian!"

"That's terrible, damn it, how could I be so unlucky..."

Cheng, Xue, Lian.

Shen Kongyin pressed the elevator button, muttering those three words to himself, lost in thought.

To make the young master of the Shen family so afraid after just one meeting... perhaps boarding this big ship in the future would be a good choice...
