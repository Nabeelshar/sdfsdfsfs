Chapter 3 Her entire body was flushed a light red…

A crisp knock sounded at the door, followed by a barely audible response from inside the office: “Come in.”

Assistant Lin entered with a smile.

Cheng Xuelian, busy reviewing documents, asked him without looking up, "What is it?"

Lin Luo: "President Cheng, it's an invitation to a banquet."

The sound of the pen sliding across the paper was obvious, but Cheng Xuelian didn't pay much attention. "Cancel it."

"Okay."

The assistant nodded and prepared to leave. Just as he closed the door, Cheng Xuelian suddenly looked up as if struck by a sudden inspiration and asked, "Whose invitation is it?"

"The Shen family. It's arranged for the evening of three days from now, at Bai Rui."

Lin Luo added, "But you have a dinner party that evening with President Chen of Huasheng."

Cheng Xuelian didn't think for long: "Go to the dinner party. I'll accompany President Chen another day."

"...Okay."

As an excellent employee, Lin Luo didn't show too much surprise, nodded slightly, and closed the door. A silence followed, and when Cheng Xuelian looked up again, it was already quite late.

The night sky in the capital was always hazy, with few stars visible. Cheng Xuelian packed her things and suddenly remembered a pair of clear eyes.

They were bright and unforgettable.

—
Three days later, the party specially held for Shen Kongyin officially began.

The hotel was luxuriously decorated, with chandeliers reflecting light and creating a dazzling spectacle.

Even before nightfall, people began to arrive.

Shen Liangyuan and his father waited at the door, whispering, "Dad, what if Cheng Xuelian doesn't come?"

Cheng Xuelian had only recently taken over, so she was naturally very busy and it was normal that she wouldn't have time. It just meant... their plans might fall through.

Shen's father pondered for a moment, then relayed Assistant Lin's exact words to him.

"He's already promised, he shouldn't break his promise. Keep a close eye on Shen Kongyin, and remember to do it cleanly and efficiently."

"I understand."

Shen Liangyuan's eyes lit up, no longer dwelling on the matter, and he darted into the crowd like a fish.

—
Shen Kongyin was wearing a newly bought suit, without any special accessories.

As the protagonist of the banquet, his attire was rather plain.

He waited quietly in an inconspicuous corner, and even though he tried his best to minimize his presence, he still attracted attention from many people, some openly, some subtly.

These gazes were either admiring or condescending, but all were unsettling.

When someone curiously approached to ask, Shen Kongyin simply smiled and brushed them off, and everyone, no longer wanting to bother him, shook their heads and walked away.

"All show and no substance..."

The boy, with innocent eyes, had naturally heard the remark, but Shen Kongyin showed no sign of anger, nor did he defend himself.

Almost simultaneously, a commotion arose at the banquet entrance, and exclamations surged like a tide. Shen Kongyin knew immediately that the person he was looking for had arrived.

He glanced at the spot where Shen Zhengxian had been standing; it was now empty.

Looks like he'd gone to greet a guest. He wondered what Cheng Xuelian's purpose was in coming.

The man, dressed in a well-tailored gray suit, looked unassuming as he slowly walked towards him.

Each step, each one exerted an invisible pressure on Shen Kongyin.

The young man's face displayed a timely look of surprise and flattery.

While Shen Zhengxian hurriedly greeted him, Cheng Xuelian merely nodded slightly, her gaze sweeping over the crowd and precisely locking onto Shen Kongyin.

She's looking over again…

Shen Kongyin held his breath, quietly awaiting his arrival.

The noise gradually faded, and when consciousness returned to reality, only a pair of large hands remained before him.

A sharp-looking man extended his hand, smiling slightly as he greeted him, "Nice to meet you, Cheng Xuelian."

Nice to meet you...?

Shen Kongyin blinked slowly, extending his hand under the intense gazes of the Shen father and son, firmly and firmly grasping the other's.

He heard his own ethereal voice: "Hello, Mr. Cheng."

—
"Why did President Cheng come to see you first?"

"Don't you know each other? Were you in the bar corridor last time?"

"Why aren't you saying anything? Did I guess right?"

After the handshake, without exchanging a single word, Cheng Xuelian was pulled aside by others to discuss business matters, surrounded by a crowd.

Halfway through the banquet, Shen Liangyuan suddenly appeared and began interrogating him relentlessly.

Shen Kongyin closed his eyes, unable to bear his attitude, and said coldly, "I don't know him. How many times do I have to say it?"

Even he, as one of the parties involved, couldn't fathom Cheng Xuelian's thoughts, let alone these people.

Shen Liangyuan clearly didn't believe him: "Why would he come to you if he doesn't know you!?"

"If you're so curious, why don't you go ask him yourself?" Shen Kongyin stood up, pointing to the crowd not far away, "It's much more effective than asking me."

Shen Liangyuan, naturally, wouldn't invite trouble. He scolded Shen Kongyin twice and went to attend to other matters.

Watching his retreating figure, Shen Kongyin felt a slight relief from the knot in his heart.

Unfortunately, the good times didn't last long. Shen Liangyuan, like a persistent leech, clung to her again.

This time, he changed tactics. His previous arrogant attitude vanished, and he picked up the tea and snacks on the table, handing them to Shen Kongyin: "Xiao Jiu, are you hungry? Want something to eat?"

His acting was very fake. Shen Kongyin paused for two seconds, wanting to see what tricks he was up to, before taking the food and saying, "Thank you."

Then she put it aside.

Shen Liangyuan: "Why aren't you eating?"

Shen Kongyin glanced at him and handed the food back to him: "You eat first."

"..."

Shen Liangyuan was full of energy. In no time, Shen Kongyin was surrounded by orange juice, desserts, coffee, milk, and a series of other snacks.

Shen Kongyin didn't touch a single one.

Shen Liangyuan: "Afraid I'll poison you?"

Shen Kongyin: "Yes."

"What?"

"Isn't that right?" Shen Kongyin looked into his eyes, her gaze so direct it sent a chill down Shen Liangyuan's spine. "Fourth Brother?"

The last "Fourth Brother" was uttered softly, almost breathlessly.

"I don't care what your plan is, but I'm warning you, don't set your sights on me."

Shen Liangyuan's smile remained unchanged: "What are you thinking? This banquet was specially organized to welcome you."

"It better be true."

Shen Kongyin rubbed his fingers, his gaze sweeping over the platters, his expression cold.

Although these items were all taken by Shen Liangyuan from the food section, and others had already eaten them, so they were safe food.

But how could Shen Liangyuan be so kind?

Shen Kongyin never touches anything that has been handled by someone else.

The English clock hanging on the wall ticked away, its hour and minute hands twitching; the time showed it was already nine o'clock in the evening.

The banquet was more than halfway through, and the Shen father and son hadn't made any significant moves yet. Shen Kongyin didn't know what they wanted, so she could only heighten her suspicions to ensure her safety.

—

“Did he take it?”

Shen Liangyuan, standing beside Madam Shen, shook his head, his face ashen. “No.”

Madam Shen smiled. “It’s alright. Being vigilant is a good thing, but unfortunately, it’s being used in the wrong place.”

“Yes, he definitely won’t suspect that the problem lies with the glass of water he drank before leaving.”

Shen Liangyuan’s expression was somewhat distorted in the lamplight, his face grim. “It’s almost time.”

“This medicine works very quickly. Keep a close eye on it; don’t let anyone intercept it.”

“Understood.”

…

Shen Kongyin had been focused throughout, and the entire banquet proceeded without incident. The banquet was nearing its end, and many people were beginning to leave early.

Looking around, she didn’t see Cheng Xuelian; perhaps she had already gone home.

The boy let out a breath, a long-lost sense of relaxation washing over him, though his head felt a little dizzy.

He abruptly changed direction, heading towards the bathroom, unaware that a figure was closely following him in the shadows.

"Splash—"

Water splashed at the sink. Shen Kongyin wiped his face, trying to clear his head.

He shook his head vigorously, but felt a slight dizziness, and his limbs felt weak.

He thought it was just from staying up late and would get better, but the next second he saw someone he didn't want to see in the mirror.

"It finally worked."

Shen Liangyuan's voice was like a urging ghost, making Shen Kongyin's heart pound uncontrollably.

He gripped the sink, his back against it, water droplets dampening his clothes and bringing a slight coolness. Shen Kongyin frowned fiercely and said, "What did you do?"

It had come to this point; even if Shen Kongyin was slow to react, he now realized something was wrong.

His reaction was wrong; this wasn't just ordinary physical discomfort!

"You don't need to know about this..."

With some remaining thought, Shen Kongyin suddenly remembered the cup of tea the maid had specially brought him before he left.

Everyone in the Shen family drank it, so why was he the only one left…?

Resentment and anger filled his mind. Before his consciousness sank into darkness, Shen Kongyin's last sensation was being supported and led away from the secluded bathroom.

—
It was hot, and he felt dizzy…

When he woke up again, Shen Kongyin's first sensation was a headache, followed by the soft bed beneath him and the scent he smelled—a cool, clean cedar fragrance, completely different from the moldy bookshelf he was familiar with.

The boy forced his heavy eyelids open, his vision blurry for a long time before focusing.

An unfamiliar ceiling, an unfamiliar room, and someone he didn't want to see…

Cheng Xuelian.

The dimly lit room was illuminated only by a small nightlight. The man sat on the sofa not far from him, a document between his fingers, his expression focused and serious.

His awakening produced a soft, yet subtle sound, but the man remained motionless, his gaze unwavering.

Shen Kongyin opened his mouth silently, somewhat speechless. He wasn't sure if Cheng Xuelian had heard him.

The soft moans continued to fill the room. Cheng Xuelian casually crumpled the paper in her hand into a ball, calmly raising her head. Her voice was low and unreadable: "Awake?"

The lack of sudden movement or approach eased Shen Kongyin's anxiety somewhat.

He forced himself to sit up, still feeling dizzy, and leaned against the headboard, his voice hoarse: "...Mmm."

There was a glass of clean water on the bedside table. The boy's gaze lingered on the glass for a moment before he frowned and looked away.

Cheng Xuelian noticed his behavior and found it somewhat amusing: "Why aren't you drinking?"

Shen Kongyin had fainted and lost consciousness because he had drunk unclean water, so naturally he dared not touch it now.

Besides... he didn't know if Cheng Xuelian and the Shen family father and son were in cahoots.

So the little guy didn't answer, only silently turning his head away.

Cheng Xuelian chuckled softly: "Don't worry, there's no poison."

Shen Kongyin simply turned his face away, sitting on the edge of the bed like a rusty wind-up puppet.

Knowing he needed time to process this, Cheng Xuelian stood up and walked to the balcony, widening the distance between them once more.

"Click—"

It was the sound of a lighter.

Looking at the seemingly harmless glass, Shen Kongyin's hand, buried under the covers, twitched, but he didn't pick it up. He merely made a barely perceptible swallowing motion.

His legs were crossed over his chest, the unease in his heart finally settling down. The boy bit his lip tightly, his thin body beginning to tremble violently.

She shouldn't have come to this lavish banquet. A surge of overwhelming hatred welled up within her. Shen Zhengxian, Shen Liangyuan—they would all pay the price for their actions…

—
The cigarette between her fingers was almost finished. Cheng Xuelian waited on the balcony for a while longer until the smoke finally dissipated.

He'd seen many shameful things—being sent to a stranger's bed by his own family—but he never expected to see Shen Kongyin tonight.

Just a few days ago, she was cunning and full of life.

Now… Shen Kongyin's sobs were faint, almost inaudible unless you listened closely, but enough to cause annoyance.

She lit another cigarette and waited quietly for it to burn out. The room had fallen silent again. Finally disappearing, Cheng Xuelian thought, the child might have already left.

The dull thud of leather shoes on the floor echoed as the man walked to the bedside, only to be met with a sensual scene.

Shen Kongyin was still there, not having left, not even gotten out of bed, his entire body flushed.

Several buttons were ripped off his white shirt, revealing a clean, pale belly, a stark contrast to the black sheets.

The light was dim, the boy's breathing rapid, fine beads of sweat forming on his forehead, his eyelashes glistening with sweat as he struggled.

He murmured incoherently; the drugs slipped into his tea were slowly eroding Shen Kongyin's reason.
