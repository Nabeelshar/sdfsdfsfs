Chapter 6 Chapter 6 Those kinds of novels with two male protagonists

It's that person again.

Shen Kongyin lowered his hand from the lamppost, stubbornly saying, "No."

He was about to go back.

Unexpectedly, the latter looked at him with a smile, not only not believing him, but also immediately seeing through Shen Kongyin's lie: "Where are you going?"

Cheng Xuelian carefully examined the boy's features. It had only been a few days, but he seemed to have lost a lot of weight.

Two days ago, Shen Zhengxian had called him, asking him to "take care" of Shen Kongyin for a while.

Of course, how one interprets the word "take care" is a matter of opinion.

According to the Shen family, this young man left alone, disappearing the day after that incident.

Unexpectedly, they bumped into each other here just two days later.

However, Shen Kongyin's attitude was noticeably worse. Perhaps emboldened by alcohol, he wasn't his usual submissive self.

The young man frowned: "Of course, back to the hotel."

Although he didn't have much money, he wasn't really as destitute as Cheng Xuelian had said, ending up homeless.

"I see."

Cheng Xuelian wasn't bothered. He pointed to a black minivan parked by the roadside: "Want me a ride home?"

Shen Kongyin's alarm bells rang. He shook his head and waved his hand: "No… I'll take a taxi."

As he spoke, he waved his phone, indicating he had already called a ride-hailing service.

This man always seemed to appear at such opportune moments. Although he had saved Shen Kongyin not long ago, he was far from worthy of his trust. Shen Kongyin thought this would make the man leave, especially since Cheng Xuelian seemed quite busy, with two other people following her at a distance.

Shen Kongyin narrowed her eyes and saw Assistant Lin, the one who had brought her breakfast last time.

The other person was unfamiliar; perhaps a business partner?

Cheng Xuelian paused, then said considerately, "Well…"

She thought this would deter him, but Cheng Xuelian changed the subject.

"It's dangerous tonight. I'll leave when the taxi arrives."

Shen Kongyin: "…"

That was just a perfunctory excuse. Shen Kongyin was planning to ride a shared bike home.

But Cheng Xuelian was so serious. Her phone suddenly felt like a hot potato; turning it off was awkward, and turning it on wasn't an option either.

Shen Kongyin's facial expressions were incredibly varied, shifting between embarrassment and guilt.

Finally, he calmed down, as if struck by a sudden thought.

After much deliberation, he decided to order a ride-hailing service in front of Cheng Xuelian.

The moment he took action, Cheng Xuelian's deep, dangerous voice arrived as expected: "Ready to call a car now?"

The young man snapped, realizing Cheng Xuelian had been teasing him, and became somewhat angry: "You knew all along."

"Know what?" The latter was still smiling, but the smile was chilling. He moved closer to Shen Kongyin, forcing him step by step to the edge of the flower bed. "You think I'm spying on you, that I have ill intentions?"

Shen Kongyin remained silent. He pursed his lips, still looking at Cheng Xuelian with unwavering defiance.

It's no wonder he overthinks things. In a place as vast as Beijing, to unexpectedly run into Cheng Xuelian again in such a short time is incredibly unlikely.

Even if his impression of her wasn't particularly bad.

Shen Kongyin remained silent, so Cheng Xuelian took two steps back, giving him breathing space.

"What I mean is..."

Before Cheng Xuelian could finish speaking, a loud shout suddenly came from behind them.

"Class monitor, what are you doing here? We've been looking for you for ages!"

It was the group of high school classmates who had coincidentally spotted Shen Kongyin.

Yuan Jiashu said, leading a large group of people to the flowerbed to look for him.

The large crowd was conspicuous, and given the restaurant's huge customer flow, this stunt had already attracted considerable attention.

Shen Kongyin, however, wore a barely perceptible expression of annoyance.

If Cheng Xuelian hadn't stopped him at the door, he would have walked several kilometers by now.

He really shouldn't have gone out today; otherwise, he wouldn't have encountered these things one after another.

Cheng Xuelian didn't turn around; his gaze remained fixed on Shen Kongyin's face, clearly seeing every expression on the boy's face.

The sounds behind him naturally didn't escape his ears either.

Even if he didn't know who the "class monitor" was calling, seeing Shen Kongyin's expression, he understood perfectly.

So he immediately made a reasonable request: "How about you come with me first?"

Shen Kongyin hesitated, a rare occurrence.

On one side was his persistent high school classmate, and on the other was Cheng Xuelian, whom he had only met three times.

He didn't want to deal with either.

But the current situation clearly didn't leave him time to think.

Perhaps due to the alcohol, Yuan Jiashu's speed was slightly enhanced, and he arrived at Shen Kongyin's side in the blink of an eye.

"Shen Kongyin, you're walking too fast! The party isn't over yet, let's go somewhere else to have some fun... huh?"

As if startled, Yuan Jiashu's voice suddenly cracked at the last sentence.

This little accident forced the previously uninterested Shen Kongyin to concentrate.

"Mr. Cheng, Mr. Cheng, it's you! We met at the graduation banquet a month ago!"

Yuan Jiashu looked excited, saying to Shen Kongyin, "I told you your clothes were real! You wouldn't admit it. You should have said you knew Mr. Cheng earlier..."

The atmosphere was already awkward enough, but after Yuan Jiashu finished speaking, the air almost froze.

Shen Kongyin: "..."

He had just forgotten about it, but this person brought it up again.

The originally thin fabric now felt scorching hot, as if a thousand ants were crawling on his skin.

But Shen Kongyin couldn't just change out; summer clothes are thin, and if he took them off, he'd be completely naked.

Cheng Xuelian's reaction was equally indifferent. He stared at Yuan Jiashu's face for two seconds, making the man feel uneasy, before speaking, "This gentleman is the young master of the Yuan family, isn't he?"

"Yes, yes, Mr. Cheng. Were you also having dinner at Zhenxiu Restaurant today? Kongyin and I were high school classmates, just now having a reunion."

There was no point in saying anything more; perhaps Yuan Jiashu had his brain squeezed in a door to come up with such an ingratiating remark.

Shen Kongyin couldn't bear to look any longer and almost closed his eyes.

Cheng Xuelian couldn't help but chuckle at the sight.

Ignoring the incessant chatter of Yuan Jiashu, Shen Kongyin suddenly felt a light touch on his shoulder.

It was Cheng Xuelian placing her hand on his shoulder.

She patted him, and even seemed to give him a squeeze?

His alcohol-fueled mind wasn't processing things quickly, and by the time Shen Kongyin tried to analyze the situation, Cheng Xuelian's actions had returned to normal.

"Well, Mr. Yuan, Kongyin and I have some things to attend to. Let's talk next time."

"Ah, okay, okay, Class Representative, let's keep in touch!"

Shen Kongyin could only give a soft "Mmm."

A gentle yet undeniable force came from around his neck and shoulders again. Knowing it was Cheng Xuelian pushing him forward, Shen Kongyin didn't resist and moved away with that force.

The noise behind him gradually faded away.

A black Cayenne was discreetly parked by the roadside. Shen Kongyin stopped and said seriously, "Mr. Cheng, I really have to go back."

Cheng Xuelian: "Mm."

Then she opened the car door: "I'll give you a ride."

The back seat was spacious, with only Assistant Lin driving.

Seeing him like this, Shen Kongyin's face paled: "I want to go back by myself..."

She tried to leave quickly, but her movements were anticipated.

She hadn't taken two steps when she felt a suffocating sensation around her neck. Looking down, Shen Kongyin realized that Cheng Xuelian had somehow grabbed her collar.

The man's voice was unpleasant: "Get in."

Shen Kongyin was anxious and tried to rush forward, but surprisingly, her clothes were of good quality; they didn't slip or tear.

Shen Kongyin, on the other hand, had been running for ages but was still stuck in the same spot, feeling a little embarrassed, and his neck was a bit sore.

He hesitated and stopped, wanting to touch his sore neck, but then felt it would be embarrassing to do so.

He gave Cheng Xuelian a reproachful look and fell silent.

What he received in return was a deep, cello-like laugh from Cheng Xuelian. He gently turned Shen Kongyin around, so that he was facing the car door.

"Get in, I'll give you a ride."

—
The seat beneath him was comfortable, and the car's air conditioning was on, making the temperature just right.

Shen Kongyin sat quietly in the back seat, his face sullen, feeling extremely annoyed.

Cheng Xuelian didn't sit in the passenger seat but sat with him in the back.

The partition in the car had been lowered by Assistant Lin long ago, but unlike in novels, there was no intimate behavior between the two.

There was even enough space in the middle for a 200-pound Yuan Jiashu to sit.

Shen Kongyin didn't even look straight ahead, but instead turned to look at the scenery outside the window.

His cheeks were puffed up, clearly he hadn't calmed down yet.

Cheng Xuelian handed him a bottle of milk: "Drink some to sober up."

"Oh."

Shen Kongyin took it, then tossed it aside, continuing to look at the scenery outside the window.

Actually, there wasn't much to see at night in Beijing, maybe some neon lights, but Shen Kongyin insisted on looking.

Cheng Xuelian stared at him for a while, then took out her phone to send a message.

The car slowed down quickly, becoming somewhat unstable, the Cayenne being jostled around like a tricycle by Lin Luo.

Shen Kongyin's mind was already a little foggy, and this swaying quickly made him drowsy.

Just as he was about to drift off, his mind wasn't quite at peace, as if he had forgotten something.

But drowsiness overwhelmed him; his head tilted to the side, and Shen Kongyin completely lost consciousness.

—
Cheng Xuelian caught the boy's head in time, preventing him from falling to the ground.

Sleeping, Shen Kongyin lacked some of his vitality, but gained a touch of tranquility.

He was beautiful no matter what.

Looking at the sleeping face before him, the man smiled slightly and moved aside.

Then, she gently and slowly placed the boy's head on her shoulder.

The partition rose silently. Lin Luo glanced back, then looked away.

The car gradually slowed, and the swaying stopped.

About half an hour later, it stopped in an underground parking garage.

Shen Kongyin was sleeping very well, not moving at all, nor talking in his sleep.

Because he had been drinking, his body was still a little hot, and his breath tickled Cheng Xuelian's neck.

Her shoulder, having been rested on her head for quite some time, was also a little warm.

Cheng Xuelian remained calm; at least her face showed no signs of anything amiss.

Lin Luo opened the car door, indicating that she could offer assistance.

Cheng Xuelian raised her hand in refusal and directly lifted Shen Kongyin out of the car.

Her figure almost completely covered the boy's body, leaving only his swaying legs visible. The two of them went up the elevator like that.

Lin Luo stayed behind, watching the boss leave, scratching his head, his face full of confusion.

He opened his phone and found his cousin, whom he hadn't contacted in a long time: 【Send me a copy of that kind of novel you mentioned before.】

Thinking, he added:

【The kind with two male leads.】
