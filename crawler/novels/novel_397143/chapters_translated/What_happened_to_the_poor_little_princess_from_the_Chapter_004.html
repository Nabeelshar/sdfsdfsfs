Chapter 4 "Why are you so obedient?"

She's very beautiful, and has enough looks to tempt someone to commit a crime.

If it were a face like that, perhaps no one could remain unmoved.

Unfortunately… today he encountered Cheng Xuelian.

The man walked to the bedside, looking down at the delirious boy, his expression calm and unmoved.

Shen Kongyin lay on the large black bed, his body burning with heat, a sliver of reason still clinging to his mind.

He didn't know what kind of drug the Shen family had given him, that could turn someone into this state in such a short time.

His vision blurred and focused, then blurred again, and vaguely, he saw a tall figure.

Who was it?

He was hot and uncomfortable. Even with the air conditioning constantly running, sweat seeped through his pores, gradually making his white shirt transparent.

Shen Kongyin placed his hands on his chest, trying to unbutton the remaining buttons, but he couldn't get it right and struggled for a long time without success.

He almost cried, looking at the tall figure beside the bed: "It's so hot...unbutton it..."

He scooted closer to the bed, his slender fingers gripping the sheets tightly.

The once smooth bed was now wrinkled from Shen Kongyin's actions, but it didn't look messy; instead, it added a unique beauty to the boy within.

"Unbutton what?"

A deep voice sounded, suddenly clearing Shen Kongyin's mind slightly.

He straightened up, blinked his dry eyes, and felt a chill run down his spine when he finally saw the figure clearly.

Cheng Xuelian…

Recalling his frivolous and outrageous actions, Shen Kongyin suddenly came to his senses.

How long had he been standing here?

Hadn't he seen everything he did?

Untie what…

Shen Kongyin's hand was still resting in front of him; he awkwardly lowered it, unable to face the question directly.

But Cheng Xuelian remained relentless. From some point, his aura had gradually become less gentle, replaced by a sharp and aggressive gaze.

As if he could see right through him.

Shen Kongyin's heart pounded slightly as he watched the boy's leather shoes tap on the floor, producing a soft, rhythmic sound.

Suppressing the urge to tremble, the boy's lips moved slightly, forcing himself not to back away.

"Awake?"

Shen Kongyin kept his head down, silent.

"I'm asking you a question."

This was the second time Cheng Xuelian had spoken. Although her tone was still patient, those who knew her knew she never liked repeating herself.

A sudden sense of unease washed over Shen Kongyin. Instinctively, he finally looked up, his round eyes widening as he warily stared at the person before him.

"...Awake."

His voice was soft, the ending unsteady, clearly indicating considerable shock.

Cheng Xuelian stared at him for two seconds, then suddenly laughed, patting his head with an unlit cigarette dangling from her lips, her tone teasing: "Poor little thing."

"Homeless now?"

A soft touch came from above his head, a fleeting touch.

It was a simple, intimate gesture, usually reserved for couples or fathers and sons, inappropriate for the two of them now.

However, strangely enough, after that head pat, the previously dry and cold atmosphere in the room gradually dissipated, the tension easing.

Shen Kongyin struggled to resist the urge to touch his own head, his tense feelings unconsciously relaxing slightly.

When he was little, his mother would pat his head like this…

Before this, Cheng Xuelian gave him a feeling of danger and coldness.

But now, it seems different…

Shen Kongyin was dizzy and almost forgot what he had been thinking.

How strange… Is the drug taking effect again?

The smile in Cheng Xuelian's eyes deepened. He hadn't expected that a simple touch could make Shen Kongyin so vulnerable and lower his guard.

“Not going to speak?”

“Speaking…”

Shen Kongyin murmured to himself, and when he realized what he had said, his expression became extremely unnatural.

A little embarrassed, he leaned against the headboard and recounted his past experience: "This... was done by the Shen family."

"I know."

The banquet ended quite late. Bai Xi was from the Cheng family business, and Cheng Xuelian had a private suite here, so she simply chose to sleep there.

Unexpectedly, on his deathbed, Shen Zhengxian specially sent someone to deliver a message, saying that something had been left in his room: "A small token of my appreciation, I hope you like it."

However... he hadn't expected that this token of appreciation came from a living person.

His own son, no less.

Recalling what happened in the bathroom, Shen Kongyin clenched his fists, his fingers making a cracking sound, which was quite jarring in the quiet room.

Cheng Xuelian gathered her thoughts, her gaze falling on his hands. She said succinctly, "Let go."

Thinking about something, she instinctively obeyed the command.

Shen Kongyin obediently released his tightly clenched hands.

After a couple of seconds, seemingly a little embarrassed, he hesitated and curled them up again.

This time, however, he didn't use force; it was gentle.

Shen Kongyin heard Cheng Xuelian chuckle softly.

He said, "Good boy."

"Why are you so obedient?"

—
"The report shows that Mr. Shen's blood contains trace amounts of [a substance], which is slowly excreted through metabolism. Injecting..."

"Hmm, arrange a ward first."

It was already past midnight, but the hospital was still overflowing.

Shen Kongyin lay on the VIP hospital bed, hooked up to an IV drip, tossing and turning, unable to sleep.

Perhaps wanting to give him a quiet environment, Cheng Xuelian left first.

The stinging pain on the back of his hand constantly reminded him that all his current suffering stemmed from Shen Liangyuan's family.

Even in his ignorance, the moment Shen Kongyin woke up in Cheng Xuelian's bed, he understood the situation.

Thankfully…

Cheng Xuelian didn't touch him, nor did she do anything inappropriate.

He probably didn't like boys.

The boy closed his eyes. With no pen and paper nearby, he mentally made a few notes about the Shen family father and son.

Thinking, Shen Kongyin turned to another page.

The boy's expression was vivid and expressive, looking somewhat conflicted.

No one knew what he had secretly recorded.

The next day.

Sunlight streamed in through the curtains. Shen Kongyin opened her eyes, reached for her bedside phone, and pressed the power button.

After charging all night, the screen finally lit up, but Shen Kongyin was immediately overwhelmed by a deluge of messages.

Most of them were from Shen Liangyuan.

Shen Liangyuan: [Let me guess, what are you doing right now?]

Shen Liangyuan: [Is it painful, being pinned down like this...?]

Shen Liangyuan: [...]

They were all vulgar words. Shen Kongyin frowned, ignoring the messages, and quickly scrolled the chat window to the bottom.

Shen Liangyuan: [Dad said that since you've done something like this, there's no need for you to stay at home any longer.]

Shen Liangyuan: [Come back, pack your things, and go see President Cheng. You worked hard all night; you deserve some compensation, right?]

Shen Liangyuan: [Evil grin.jpg]

Shen Kongyin calmly read all the messages.

He hadn't expected the Shen family to be so ruthless, even going so far as to take away his only residence in the Shen family home.

On the contrary, Cheng Xuelian, whom they portrayed as ruthless and vicious, didn't seem as insidious as Shen Zhengxian.

A deep sense of powerlessness washed over him. Shen Kongyin glanced at the wound on the back of his hand and noticed that it had been bandaged up.

Perhaps the nurse had helped.

Lifting the covers and straightening her clothes, Shen Kongyin was suddenly met with a loud knock at the door.

She went to open it.

A young man in a sharp suit stood before her, carrying several bags and a lunchbox.

He looked surprised to see Shen Kongyin and quickly offered his hand to help her up: "Mr. Shen, you're awake so early."

Shen Kongyin didn't recognize him.

But before the young man could ask a question, Lin Luo proactively explained his identity: "I'm President Cheng's special assistant. You can just call me Assistant Lin."

As he spoke, he entered the room and placed the breakfast from the lunchbox on the table.

"These are breakfast and clothes that President Cheng asked me to bring."

Shen Kongyin's gaze fell on the breakfast, a look of surprise on her face.

He recognized the logo on the box; it was from a restaurant called Zhenxiulou.

Having followed Shen Liangyuan around for so long, he often heard the young masters complain about how difficult it was to book a meal at Zhenxiulou, requiring reservations months in advance, let alone takeout.

He hadn't expected Cheng Xuelian to actually arrange for these things to be delivered directly.

Lin Luo's words faintly echoed in his ears: "President Cheng means that you are weak and should rest properly."

A long-simmered porridge, jade shrimp shumai, vegetable soup…

Looking at these, Shen Kongyin's stomach finally protested. He turned to Lin Luo and asked, "Did Mr. Cheng instruct you to have all of this?"

Lin Luo: "Yes."

"...Alright."

Everyone had personally brought it over, the timing perfect. Shen Kongyin was hungry at the moment, so he sat down and finished everything.

However… this Assistant Lin seemed to have something to do and hadn't left.

After Shen Kongyin finished his breakfast, he took a key from his pocket and handed it to the table in front of him.

The latter naturally looked up in confusion.

Lin Luo smiled and said, "This is Mr. Cheng's private residence. He said that if you don't want to stay at the Shen family's anymore, you can go there anytime."

"The address is the 34th floor of Building 1 in Lijiang. You can move in directly."

Shen Kongyin listened quietly to Lin Luo's words, then firmly pushed the key back: "I'm sorry, I can't take it."

Cheng Xuelian taking him to the hospital was already more than enough.

The breakfast could be described as meticulous, but Shen Kongyin knew that he absolutely could not accept this key.

Before last night, he and Cheng Xuelian were strangers, and even after everything that happened last night, they couldn't be called familiar.

Accepting all this meant that their relationship was no longer innocent.

Not to mention…

Shen Kongyin's fingers unconsciously tapped the table. Even if Cheng Xuelian took pity on him and offered temporary help,

the breakfast and clothes were one thing, but the house and lodging far exceeded the scope of "kindness."

Besides, this person's reputation outside wasn't nearly as good as she'd heard.

In conclusion, Shen Kongyin still looked up and smiled at Lin Luo: "I received the clothes and breakfast. Please thank Mr. Cheng for me."

"Okay, I'll pass on the message later."

Since he didn't accept it, Assistant Lin didn't insist and left with the food box.
