Chapter 5 Homeless and Wandering?

Lin Luo pushed open the door: "President Cheng, the things have been delivered."

Cheng Xuelian's gaze swept over the keys in his hand: "He didn't take them?"

"Yes."

Hearing her assistant say this, the corners of Cheng Xuelian's mouth turned up slightly, seemingly in a good mood. She waved casually: "I know."

Lin Luo hesitated slightly. In the years he had worked by Cheng Xuelian's side, he had rarely shown such an expression.

"Is there anything else?"

Cheng Xuelian asked proactively, and Lin Luo recounted Shen Kongyin's behavior that morning: "She ate porridge the fastest for breakfast. I asked the doctor, and her bodily functions haven't been affected."

"Hmm."

Lin Luo smiled: "Oh, by the way, Young Master Shen asked me to tell him his thanks."

Receiving the order to deliver breakfast so early in the morning, Lin Luo initially thought her boss had been kidnapped.

After all, Cheng Xuelian was usually obsessed with power and had little interaction with the ladies of the outside world; there wasn't even a single scandal about her.

Not to mention those who wanted to pair her up; Cheng Xuelian's reputation was bad, and no boss wanted to push their daughter into a wolf's den.

Lin Luo thought this time she would finally see something different.

After all, it was morning, and he'd specifically asked to buy an outfit, and the meeting place was a hospital.

Having read countless CEO romance novels over the years, Lin Luo couldn't help but overthink it.

Turns out he was right about everything except the gender; a young boy opened the door.

He really was young, looking about the same age as his nephew.

"What, is there something else?"

Seeing her assistant standing motionless, Cheng Xuelian didn't rush him, casually asking.

“Ah, no, no, Ms. Cheng, I’ll be going now.”

“Wait—”

Cheng Xuelian paused, rubbing her brow. “Check the Shen family’s information for me, especially that new Xiao Jiu.”

“Okay.”

Lin Luo closed the door and returned to his workstation. His secretary came in to greet him warmly, “Assistant Lin, why do you look so distressed? Did Ms. Cheng scold you?”

Lin Luo smiled slightly, “Have you finished compiling the finance department’s data? I need it submitted before noon.”

The secretary muttered a curse under her breath and quickly left.

Assistant Lin stood there muttering to himself, even opening his phone to search for relevant information.

“The Shen family…”

He remembered that company was almost bankrupt. Was there any need to investigate?

—

Here, Shen Kongyin had returned to the Shen family home.

It was a workday, and Shen Zhengxian had apparently gone to the company, along with Shen Liangyuan, who had also disappeared. Only the maid was cleaning the large living room.

No one greeted Shen Kongyin upon his return.

Shen Kongyin went straight to his room on the second floor without looking around.

Remembering the threatening text message on his phone, Shen Kongyin frowned slightly, scanning the room he had lived in for less than a month.

Even after so long, Shen Kongyin could still smell the musty odor.

It was a dark, shadowy corner, much like his predicament these past few days.

And now, it was all going to end.

He was leaving the Shen family, leaving this nauseating place.

He didn't have much stuff; a single suitcase could hold it all, no need to call a moving company.

The Shen family's courtyard was large and beautifully maintained, filled with roses according to the mistress's wishes.

"Young Master, are you leaving?"

As Shen Kongyin arrived, an auntie was pruning the rose branches, and she was quite surprised to see him like this.

"Yes."

Shen Kongyin stopped in his tracks, thought for a moment, and then asked Auntie Wang a few words. She was one of the few people who had shown him any concern during his time at the Shen family.

But today, it was destined that they would part ways.

The sound of the suitcase rolling gradually faded into the distance. Aunt Wang watched him leave, rubbing the chapped wounds on her hands, opening her mouth, unsure what to say.

—
After leaving, Shen Kongyin blocked and deleted all contact information for the Shen family from his phone.

Returning home abruptly would surely worry Huaiyu, so Shen Kongyin decided to stay in Beijing for a while, hoping to find a job.

…Preferably tutoring or something similar.

Shen Kongyin eventually found a hotel to stay in.

In the evening, perhaps Shen Liangyuan had already discovered his departure, as he sent Shen Kongyin many messages from someone else's phone number.

【You're gone?】

【So fast, are you already eager to go find Cheng Xuelian?】 [A person should accept their fate. You've done things for the family, and your father and I will remember your kindness.]

Seeing this disgusting tone, Shen Kongyin knew these were all from the same person.

He didn't reply, expressionlessly blocking all the numbers.

At the same time, a message suddenly appeared in the high school class group chat.

Yuan Jiashu: [Has our class had a reunion yet?]

Yuan Jiashu: [I'm treating everyone to dinner, and we can chat about future life plans.]

The speaker was Shen Kongyin's high school class monitor, from a wealthy family, generous and kind, and therefore very popular in high school, with a bunch of followers.

They were all recent graduates, and soon people started replying.

After sending a long string of messages, Yuan Jiashu finally reappeared: 【But I'm back in Beijing after the college entrance exam. The restaurant is Zhenxiulou, it's super expensive, I booked it way in advance.】

With the internet so developed, places like Zhenxiulou are like high-end hotels, widely known without advertising, and people immediately started flattering them.

【Same name as the Zhenxiulou online?】

【Too bad I'm not in Beijing, it's too far.】

【The class monitor is treating, I have to go! I'll take pictures and post them on WeChat Moments.】

These are all meaningless messages. Shen Kongyin glanced at them and was about to turn off her phone when someone suddenly tagged her.

Yuan Jiashu: 【@Shen Kongyin, class monitor, I saw your location is in Beijing, remember to come!】 That's the downside of the big data era; even IP addresses can be pinpointed so precisely.

Shen Kongyin wasn't that close to Yuan Jiashu and initially wanted to refuse, but Yuan Jiashu's repeated requests, and Shen Kongyin also wanting to use this opportunity to relax, led her to agree.

0w0: [Okay, I have time recently.]

This earned her a cheer from Yuan Jiashu.

—
Shen Kongyin's information was minimal, just two thin sheets of paper.

Cheng Xuelian's gaze swept over them inch by inch, her eyes glued to the page, until she turned to the third page and realized it had changed to Shen Zhengxian's.

He looked away, turning to Lin Luo: "Why are there other people's?"

Lin Luo's smile froze for a moment, but he maintained his professional demeanor and said, "You're the one who told me to investigate the Shen family."

He'd been working overtime for the past two days, researching information, even finding out the origins of the big yellow dog kept at the Shen family's gate.

And now… he was being told he only needed Shen Kongyin's information??

Cheng Xuelian removed the remaining thick stack of papers, leaving only the top ones: "Shred these."

Lin Luo's smile almost crumbled: "...Yes, Ms. Cheng."

The air fell silent again.

Cheng Xuelian calmly scanned two thin A4 sheets of paper—they contained records of a boy's first eighteen years of life.

Her gaze shifted to the bottom, where two simple sentences were written: "June 16th, taken to the capital by the Shen family, life is not going well."

Thinking of those clear eyes, Cheng Xuelian sneered.

It wasn't just life being bad; the Shen family was practically devouring her, squeezing out every last bit of value.

—
Soon, the day of the class reunion arrived.

Although everyone had taken the college entrance exam in their original provinces, many classmates still bought tickets to come to the capital just to catch a glimpse of the exquisite restaurant.

Shen Kongyin arrived neither too early nor too late; when she found her private room, several young people were already seated inside.

They greeted Shen Kongyin excitedly upon seeing him: "Class monitor, it's been so long! I didn't expect you to be in Beijing too."

Shen Kongyin nodded in acknowledgment: "Yeah, long time no see."

Everyone had changed a lot. The boys had permed hair, and the girls were wearing makeup; they were completely different from when they were in school.

Yuan Jiashu stood up to shake his hand, but then, seeing something, his eyes lit up, and he exclaimed in surprise.

"Wow, Brother Shen, is that some international brand you're wearing? The fit is amazing!"

His family was well-off, and he often flaunted his wealth back in high school.

However, Yuan Jiashu was very generous to his classmates, and everyone accepted his behavior.

Shen Kongyin was taken aback. He didn't buy clothes often, but having decided to attend the gathering, he wore the casual clothes Cheng Xuelian had given him earlier.

The clothes didn't have any special brand logos. Shen Kongyin had even carefully checked if the tags had been removed, but after inspection, he found no loose threads or labels.

Therefore, he reasonably assumed it was just an ordinary no-name brand.

This was why he felt comfortable wearing the clothes today; he hadn't expected someone to notice something was wrong so quickly.

Several intense gazes focused on him, feeling as if they could scorch him.

Shen Kongyin calmly replied, "No, I just bought it from a roadside stall."

Yuan Jiashu immediately breathed a sigh of relief. "I knew it! These little brands are like that, they have no respect for originality whatsoever."

As he spoke, he seemed to imply something: "I still remember the information the class representative filled out back then, my family was registered as rural residents..."

This was a rather tactless remark, but Shen Kongyin simply hummed in agreement, not taking it to heart.

He walked to the round table and sat down, quietly waiting for the banquet to begin.

People kept arriving, and everyone greeted him cheerfully.

Shen Kongyin held his wine glass, observing the scene with great interest. They all had youthful faces, yet they had mastered nine-tenths of the flattery and sycophancy typical of traditional banquets.

That's a kind of talent, isn't it?

By the time the food arrived, the group was completely drunk and rambling incoherently.

Shen Kongyin lowered his weary eyes, feeling a pang of regret.

He shouldn't have come; he'd gained absolutely nothing.

He'd come to have some fun, but instead of relaxing, his mood had become even heavier.

And his clothes—they'd never felt so prominent before, to the point that he desperately wanted to take them off.

Although Yuan Jiashu had low emotional intelligence and wasn't good with words, he'd never misjudged luxury goods.

Shen Kongyin had no doubt about the value of his current attire.

If only he'd come in a short-sleeved shirt, he wouldn't be so restless now.

Time passed, and dusk fell.

Some girls had already started suggesting leaving.

Yuan Jiashu, quite drunk, still managed to suggest they go somewhere else.

"There's a new KTV in Beijing, my treat, let's go there."

Having someone pay is always best, and basically everyone agreed.

Even in his drunken state, Yuan Jiashu couldn't forget to search for someone from his memory: "Where's the class representative? Have you seen Shen Kongyin?"

"No, he seems to have left..."

The former was greatly disappointed, slurring, "That kid's really rich now, do you know how much that outfit he's wearing is worth?"

"How much?"

"Six figures!"

As he spoke, Yuan Jiashu held up a five.

Everyone exchanged bewildered glances, several black lines appearing on their foreheads: "...Are you drunk?"

Everyone had witnessed Shen Kongyin's past misbehavior and didn't believe his one-sided story.

Meanwhile, Shen Kongyin had already slipped out of the private room during the chaos.

He'd been egged on and couldn't refuse, so he'd taken a few sips of wine, thinking it wasn't too strong and would make him sober enough to get home. But as soon as he stepped outside, the evening breeze made his head spin.

The world suddenly felt dark, and his stomach churned.

Shen Kongyin: "..."

What kind of wine is this at Zhenxiulou? How come it's even stronger than the wine he brews at home?

Shen Kongyin was usually very confident in his alcohol tolerance; he didn't know what was wrong with him this time.

Perhaps it was a lingering effect of being drugged a few days ago?

Leaning against the streetlamp, in a daze, Shen Kongyin suddenly heard a familiar voice.

A tall figure came into view; Cheng Xuelian, a smirk playing on her lips, was looking down at him.

"Before, you were homeless; now... you're wandering the streets?"
