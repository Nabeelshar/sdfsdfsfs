Chapter 2 Chapter 2 So, at least Shen Kongyin is somewhat useful…

Cheng Xuelian pushed open the door to the private room and slowly stepped inside.

There weren't many people inside, only two or three, chatting idly.

Seeing him finally arrive, they lazily and emphatically welcomed him from afar: “You finally found some time.”

Cheng Xuelian walked to their side, naturally sitting in the main seat, and picked up her wine glass, swirling it a couple of times.

“Mine?”

“Of course,” Jiang Qi chuckled, starting to egg them on, “Since you’re late, you have to drink! Tonight, we won’t leave until we’re drunk!”

Jiang Qi had been back in China for a while, and Cheng Xuelian had been busy recently, only finding time tonight. Hearing this, she didn’t refuse, picking up her glass and taking a sip.

The initial taste was bitter and spicy, with a slightly astringent aftertaste—a flavor he liked.

However, seeing him like this, Jiang Qi couldn't sit still any longer. He leaned closer, his hand on his chin as if deep in thought: "Something's not right with you."

Xie Ming'an echoed, "Something's not right."

Cheng Xuelian: "What?"

Jiang Qi: "When I called you, you said you'd arrived. Why did it take you so long?"

Xie Ming'an slammed his glass down on the table with a clatter, stating definitively, "Did you run into the Shen family?"

Cheng Xuelian's lips curled into a smile: "Why do you say that?"

That was a definite yes.

Jiang and Xie exchanged a glance, both seeing surprise in each other's eyes.

“A group of kids were playing next door, the Shen family was in there too. I ran into them when I arrived.”

“You were stopped by the young master of the Shen family? What a coincidence?”

Cheng Xuelian finally finished her three glasses of wine, picked up the bottle and refilled it, her tone leisurely: “President Xie, you have a good eye.”

“Come on,” Xie Ming’an interjected, “Speaking of which, this matter is also related to you. Shen Zhengxian is almost going crazy now, looking for crooked ways to get things done.”

Cheng Xuelian finally became interested: “Tell me about it.”

Xie Ming’an recounted the general details. Beijing is a large market, with family businesses deeply rooted there, and many of them are opportunistic and disruptive to the market.

After taking over, Cheng Xuelian first purged several old employees from the company, and then proposed the "Integrity Plan."

The core of the plan was compliance and legality, requiring all member companies to have transparent finances and standardized employment practices. Furthermore, the Cheng family, as an industry leader, proactively joined, setting an example.

Although it appeared on the surface that everyone joined voluntarily, everyone knew behind the scenes that companies that didn't follow Cheng Xuelian's new rules would sooner or later be kicked out of the upper class.

Jiang Qi then added fuel to the fire: "You know the Shen family's situation. They practically worship their ancestors for eighteen generations, and all their relatives work in the company. How can that be legal?"

Xie Ming'an added calmly: "With business partners actively defecting, the Shen family is now being excluded by various companies, and the banks that previously provided loans are starting to demand repayment early."

The rest is self-evident. Once the banks demand repayment early, the Shen family's cash flow will be disrupted, and all that awaits them is a stock market crash, leading to bankruptcy.

"I see."

Cheng Xuelian listened without speaking, her fingers tapping heavily on the table. She stared at the swirling liquid in her glass, lost in thought.

Shen Kongyin looked at the car keys in his hand and waited with Shen Liangyuan by the car.

He didn't have a driver's license and couldn't drive. Traffic police were strict at night, and he could easily be taken in for questioning.

Shen Liangyuan grumbled as he went to find a designated driver: "Didn't you say you could drive?"

Shen Kongyin raised an eyebrow: "A tricycle is a car too."

"..."

Shen Liangyuan angrily scolded him a few more times and started looking for a designated driver on his phone.

Fifteen minutes later, the two were sitting together in the back seat.

The Shen family villa was far away, and Shen Kongyin was already very sleepy. There were many traffic lights along the way, and the constant stopping and starting made him carsick.

When he got home, his face was deathly pale, looking even worse than Shen Liangyuan, who had been drinking all night, as if he had eaten something unclean.

Shen Liangyuan was startled by his appearance, muttered "bad luck," slammed the door, and disappeared.

In the empty living room, Shen Kongyin stood up, looking at the deserted space. The vulnerability in his eyes vanished instantly, leaving only clarity.

He returned to his guest room on the second floor. Opening the door, he was greeted by the musty smell of the bookshelves—no one had lived there for a long time; it had even been used as a storage room.

But now Shen Kongyin lived here.

It was called a storage room, but it was actually much larger than his previous living space.

Although the Shen family members were somewhat abnormal, they had at least given him a place to live. As long as nothing went wrong in the coming days, he could safely go to university and then move out.

“Ring ring—”

The phone in his pocket rang unexpectedly. After seeing the contact name, a normal smile finally appeared on Shen Kongyin's face.

"Hello?"

The girl on the other end of the phone was very excited: "Brother, I'm finally back from my holiday! I'm calling you so late, are you still awake?"

Shen Kongyin didn't answer directly: "What's wrong, Xiaoyu? Is something the matter?"

Huaiyu hesitated for a moment, then tentatively asked, "I heard from Dad that you went out to work, is that right?"

"Are you tired? If your boss doesn't treat you well, you should come home. I haven't seen you in so long, brother..."

Hearing the childish voice on the other end of the phone, Shen Kongyin was unusually silent.

Going out to work was an excuse. Huaiyu was too young to understand these things, and exposing her to complicated matters too early wasn't good for her.

Besides...

The boy forced a smile. His recent days had indeed been less comfortable than when he was working.

He could at least earn a few cents working odd jobs, but here he was suspected of coveting the family fortune.

Although he'd heard the company was doing poorly and was about to go bankrupt, at least it could hold on for another year or two.

"Are you listening, brother?"

Huaiyu's questioning voice briefly pulled Shen Kongyin back to reality.

"Yes, I'm doing well in Beijing. Be a good boy at home, listen to Dad, and finish your homework on time. I'll come back as soon as I'm done with this."

His sister on the phone readily agreed, but Shen Kongyin's expression was serious, feeling lost about the future.

Go back?

This was the last thing he wanted. If he could escape unscathed, that would be fine, but what if the Shen family wouldn't let him go, and he had to leave in a mess? Lying on the bed, less than two meters wide, Shen Kongyin began to reminisce about the past.

It was the Shen family who personally found him. In truth, the moment he learned his true identity, Shen Kongyin felt fortunate.

Fortunate that his life, which seemed to have no end, could still take a turn for the better.

The car sent by the Shen family to pick him up was expensive; he recognized it immediately, which was why he agreed to leave with them and change his name.

Initially, he shared the surname Huai, like Huaiyu.

"Huaijiu Kongyin Wendi Fu"—his name came from this poem, given to him by his long-deceased mother.

However, things had changed now; his mother had also passed away many years ago, making the name somewhat fitting.

The capital city at night was still brightly lit, filled with light pollution, unlike the beautiful scenery back home. Unable to sleep, Shen Kongyin got up to drink water, a veil of intangible worry hanging over him.

He didn't know if his choice was right. If he couldn't protect himself in the days to come, leaving the Shen family would be safer…

A pair of meaningful eyes suddenly flashed into his mind.

Shen Kongyin frowned, beginning to consider the possibility…

-
Unfortunately, fate had other plans. A few days later, one morning, Madam Shen knocked on his door, saying she wanted to host a welcome banquet for him.

She was Shen Zhengxian's third wife.

"You've worked hard these past few days. We've seen the gossip, but after this banquet, we'll consider it official recognition of your status."

"When the Cheng family comes, remember to behave generously and appropriately, don't be petty..."

Clearly, she had observed Shen Kongyin's usual behavior: "I heard you went out with Liangyuan last night? Young people should go out more..."

Now, she was specifically instructing him on these things, merely to maintain the Shen family's reputation.

Shen Kongyin sneered inwardly: "I know."

Madam Shen happily handed him a card: "The password is 166277. Go to the mall and pick out some decent clothes, don't wear this anymore..."

As she spoke, she scanned Shen Kongyin up and down, her contempt evident.

Shen Kongyin pretended not to see, taking the bank card and saying indifferently, "Yes, Madam."

The moment the door closed, the gentle expression on the young man's face vanished.

If there was a welcome banquet, why not hold it from the beginning, instead of waiting until this special occasion?

Shen Kongyin sat down at his desk with a cold expression, took out paper and pen, and wrote the words "Welcome Banquet" on a notebook. He then wrote "Shen Family," "Cheng Family," and "Integrity Plan," among other things.

The handwriting was messy and illegible, showing considerable effort was put into it.

After finishing, Shen Kongyin casually drew a few arrows, each pointing in a different direction.

He had been back at the Shen family for some time now. If Madam Shen truly wanted to welcome him, she should have started preparing for this long ago, instead of suddenly informing him on an ordinary morning.

It seemed like a spur-of-the-moment decision.

Shen Kongyin had been reading the news for the past few days and knew that Feixun had been making significant moves lately.

Combined with Madam Shen's specific instructions, it wasn't hard to guess—

Perhaps… the welcoming banquet was a pretense; the Shen family's true purpose was to use it as a means to climb the social ladder and gain favor with the Cheng family.

Shen Kongyin lowered his eyelashes, a sudden sense of unease rising in his heart.

Why would Madam Shen specifically mention Cheng Xuelian's arrival?

His pen hovered heavily over those three words, the young man recalling his brief encounter with this man not long ago—the man's deep gaze and enigmatic smile.

At nine in the morning, the sunlight outside the window was bright, but it couldn't penetrate the cold, gloomy guest room.

Shen Kongyin's heart sank. He didn't know Cheng Xuelian's motives for helping him, but perhaps…

Preparing himself mentally, the young man closed his notebook, his expression calm.

…It was just a casual gesture.

—
Meanwhile, in the study.

Shen Liangyuan's voice was excited: "Dad, Mom has already given him the bank card, and the venue for the welcome banquet has been arranged. The invitations have all been sent out. When Cheng Xuelian arrives, we'll take him to his room, and that will show our appreciation!"

Shen Zhengxian rubbed his aching temples, remaining silent for a long time.

His thoughts weren't as simple as Shen Liangyuan's. Although the newly found Xiao Jiu was indeed handsome, what if Cheng Xuelian didn't like men? Wouldn't that be sending him to the wrong person? This person usually has no scandals or gossip. Previous attempts to send gifts to minor celebrities all ended in failure.

If they send it to Shen Kongyin, and he gets angry, not only Shen Kongyin, but the entire Shen family will be in trouble.

This is a risky move.

If things go wrong…

The more Shen's father thought about it, the more uneasy he felt. He reached out to call his son back, but Shen Liangyuan had already excitedly gone out: “Don’t worry, Dad, this will definitely be done!”

Others might not know, but he knew very well.

When they met by chance at the bar, Shen Liangyuan had drunk too much and wasn’t thinking clearly.

It wasn’t until he sobered up the next day that he realized something was wrong.

Although Cheng Xuelian was speaking to him, her gaze was elsewhere. There were only three people present: the two of them and Shen Kongyin.

Therefore, Shen Liangyuan was certain that Cheng Xuelian was interested in his "ninth brother," and he resorted to underhanded tactics, devising a plan to send him over.

Shen Zhengxian, seeing his confident demeanor, remained silent, finally waving his hand and saying, "So be it, just an illegitimate child."

At least Shen Kongyin could contribute something to the family; at least he was somewhat useful.
